9/28/2017,4.0 star rating,"I  really liked their menu set up. Fresh fish selection changed by the day, with a suggested preparation. 
I had an ahi steak which was a hearty portion and so tasty. Could barely finish it!
Tried a nibble of my brothers coconut crusted fish it was sooo good! 
They had a nice live singer with guitar.
The only reason I don't give this restaurant a full 5 stars is the ambience was loud and hectic. The bar was hopping and between that, the live music, having the raise my voice to speak to my server and a PACKED restaurant it just felt a little stressful. Our server had a great smile and sweet attitude,  but I sensed a bit of hurried panic in her eyes (lol)",Amy E.,"Fremont, CA",4.0 star rating

He had parmesan crusted Mahi.  He said it was the best fish and caper sauce he ever had and would eat here every night.

The service, sounds of the Ocean, and food were outstanding!!!!",Jill C.,"Puerto Real, Puerto Rico",4.0 star rating
9/17/2017,3.0 star rating,"Beautiful beachfront restaurant in Lahaina town!

This is a beautiful restaurant & we came poorly dressed without a reservation, thank you for letting us dine!  We were a table behind the beachfront but still had gorgeous views.

Friendly customer service.  Good food.  This is the sister restaurant of a few popular places that I have previously dined at- Duke's, Jakes Del Mar, Hula Grill.  

Bread & Carrot Muffins:  Complimentary.
Macadamia Nut Calamari:  Chunky strips of calamari.  I wish these were thinly sliced rings instead.  I was not a fan of the texture or the bland taste.
Parmesan Crusted Mahi-Mahi:  This was good, but for the price, I expected better.  I say get their Hawaiian fish instead because our waitress said it was buttery & savory.
Prime Rib 14 oz.:  Even as the smaller cut, you could share this amongst 2.  Very hearty, corners of fat, a lot of food.
Original Hula Pie:  They also have a chef's creation Hula Pie but you cannot go wrong with the classic!  A must get when in Hawaii.  & a piece of pie this size needs to be shared!  I enjoyed the thick layer of chocolate alongside the sweet macadamia ice cream with the cookie crust crunch.  Mmm!",Saleen D.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating
8/31/2017,5.0 star rating,"One of my My favorite restaurants in Maui  with a view and food to die for. 

You obviously want to try the fresh fish, however they are well known for their steaks and other dishes too. Fish isn't your thing? That's ok! They have kalua pork ribs, roasted chicken, and wonderful pastas too! 


1. Make a reservation and request a view next to the ocean. Take in the views and listen to the waves crash and their soft live music in the background. 
2. I recommend reservation at 6pm to see sunset while enjoying your meal. 
3. Order Mai tai - to die for 
4. My favorites I recommend are the kalua pork ribs, coconut crusted fish with Thai sauce and pineapple salsa.",Amber V.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating
9/22/2017,4.0 star rating,"After lunch, we wanted to go people watch on the boardwalk and later grab a drink.  Kimo's fit the bill.  They had a large out door pavaillion facing the water.  It was a great experience to sit down, relax, and watch the surf and boats in Lahaina Harbor.  Touristy for sure, with prices to match, but so were we!  Would love to check out their menu next time.  Will repeat when my travels bring me back to Lahaina, recommend!",Dan O.,"Madison Heights, MI",4.0 star rating
8/30/2017,4.0 star rating,"We had two things to accomplish with this meal: we wanted a burger and we wanted to watch the sunset. Kimo's was right near ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" which would be a normal 'go-to' - but using Yelp we found that the burgers at Kimo's are ""legendary,"" so of course we headed into Kimo's. 

We got a table right on the water in the bar area (which was perfect for us, being that we only wanted burgers and a beer). We absolutely loved the location. Watching the sunset was ideal, and they had an excellent band playing music during the sunset. It was the perfect setting. 

The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, didn't seem weirded out that we only wanted a burger (the menu is quite pricier than just burgers), and remained friendly the entire meal. 

Our burgers were FANTASTIC. We absolutely loved them. They were so juicy and flavorful, I could have eaten one every night of our vacation if I wasn't concerned at all about fitting into a bikini at the same time. 

Overall, great place!",Shauna S.,"Campbell, CA",4.0 star rating
8/28/2017,3.0 star rating,"Came back to Kimo's and was disappointed to find out they no longer have the lobster sliders with truffle chips on their happy hour menu! That's pretty much why my sister and I would always go there when we visit Maui. Our waitress said they replaced that menu option with the buffalo chicken bites. We ordered that but it wasn't anything special or out of this world! It was typical of what you'd get at other places. Also, we got the Macadamia crusted calamari....still didn't get the Macadamia part. We also ordered the avocado poke stack. The poke wasn't really cold! I don't like poke that isn't cold. My sister did get their cheeseburger this time. It was huge and looked/smelled really good! She couldn't even finish it. She said it was juicy and tasty. 

This place is a nice, ocean-front spot. It is pretty pricey though. We went to Cafe O Lei at the Dunes  and our bill came out significantly less even though we ordered more (I've left a review and photos of what we ordered there so you can see). Unless they bring back the lobster sliders, there's really nothing that would call me to come back here.",Jackie O.,"Mililani, HI",4.0 star rating
7/19/2017,5.0 star rating,"I'd say this place is a bit on the higher end of meals but with a casual atmosphere.

Food: 5 stars
The food was really delicious and prepared beautifully. We ordered the wedge salad and coconut prawns which came with a delightful dipping sauce. Dinner consisted of the market fish and pork lettuce wraps (just ok) since we weren't starving at that point.
 
Service: 5 stars
Service was really great and it's nice that the server deals with the food and the bar sends other people out to bring drinks and take care of refills. Never experienced that before and thought it was a great idea.

Location: 5 stars
Located on the busy/fun Front street in Lahaina, this location offers an open air atmosphere which is really nice.",Sara M.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating
6/19/2017,5.0 star rating,"It's funny because the only reason we came here was because my boyfriend's friend had the same name as the restaurant.. but who knew it'd turn out to be one of our favorite meals in Maui!

We were lucky enough to just get there right when they opened. We were just around the area snacking on shaved ice and crispy teri bites before coming here too! We didn't have reservations but we were seated upstairs and had a nice view of the ocean. 

Our server gave us his best recommendations and we chose from there. I ordered their coconut crusted marlin which had thai peanut sauce and maui gold pineapple salsa. My boyfriend went with their koloa pork ribs which was seasoned with plum bbq sauce and cooked traditional Koloa Kauai style. I loved both dishes! My boyfriend said their ribs were better than Firestone's in SLO. The meat was tender and easy to peel off! I wish the fish was served with mashed potatoes though, but that's alright, it was still delicious!

I definitely recommend trying this out if you're in Lahaina. Maybe make reservations so you can sit downstairs out near the ocean front!",Sydney C.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
8/19/2017,3.0 star rating,"Kimo's is in a great location: right on Front Street near the outlets and right on the water where you can get a beautiful view of the water, the mountains, and the parasailers. One caution about sitting right next to the water, on the balcony, is that sometimes the waves that crash against the wall can splash up and get you. Our table actually had some water on it when they seated us, yet they didn't mention anything or offer to switch tables. It wasn't a huge hindrance, since it was hot and it only happened once or twice, but it is still something worth mentioning.

The menu doesn't really stand out from other restaurants in the area. There are options for seafood and meat. One thing that's cool is that all of the fish dishes change based on the daily catch! This adds some cool variation to the menu!

The prices seemed a bit more reasonable, but when the food arrived, I noticed that the portions were quite small. I ordered the coconut crusted fish, which had a good coconut flavor, but there was pretty much no pineapple salsa, and the fish itself was smaller than one of those tiny burgers you'd find on the McDonald's dollar menu.

In the end, Kimo's is a really enjoyable restaurant to eat at: with good views and friendly service. The location is great, and it would be a fine choice to make if you're strolling on Front Street. However, I feel like it'd be a place where I would want to get drinks and maybe some shareables instead of getting a full meal.",Austin T.,"Bellevue, WA",4.0 star rating
6/1/2017,5.0 star rating,"This time, 3 years after my last visit, Diane and I left our cruise ship to specifically eat an entire lunch here, finishing with another slice of fabulous Hula Pie.  Seated at a table facing the bay and Oceania Sirena anchored only about 10 minutes away, we began with an order of rather unique Macadamia Nut Crusted Calamari: lengths of a crispy and golden, nut-dotted deep-fried shell encasing meaty white squid within, served with Cocktail Sauce.  

Our shared app was followed by nice dark blonde Fish & Chips for Diane, and Kimo's Klassic Cheesburger & Fries for me.  The fish was moist and tasty, featuring tender marlin inside slightly crisp but pliable batter.  The well-made standard-sized French Fries were slightly crispy on the outside and supple on the inside.  My half-pound burger was perfectly medium rare as ordered, and graced by well-melted Cheddar Cheese, fresh tomato slices, and shredded Iceberg Lettuce all conjoined by a mellow Maui Island Dressing.  Each bite was a crunchy, multi-layered delight.

Since we are in Hawaii only about every 3 years, I almost ordered my own Hula Pie, but after reading my previous review's admonition and seeing a single humongous order pass by me on the way to a fellow diner's table, I realized that doing so would be inviting sugar shock, and an unfinished dessert.  So, I refrained, and once again split an order with Diane.  Without question, when it arrived this huge confection was large enough for 2 or more diners to share.

Utilizing the combination forks/spoons created specifically for this sweet treat, we systematically reduced our mountain of Macadamia Nut-crusted Original Hula Pie to rubble, with its steep cliff covered with Chocolate Fudge and Hot Fudge Sauce blanketing Macadamia Nut Ice Cream resting on a moist Oreo Cookie crust and supported by a long and thick trail of Whipped Cream.  Eventually the edible rubble became just a smear on the specially decorated Hula Pie plate as we lapped up all of the deliciousness of this inventive and fabled dish.  

Service was friendly and very good in a great, oceanfront dining setting.  I look forward to our next visit years hence!",Dennis T.,"North Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating
9/12/2017,5.0 star rating,"We visited Kimo's a few times during our trip to Lahaina. All of us really enjoyed the ribs, which had a great sauce on them! On our second visit we were just looking for a very light meal as we were eating late, the lettuce wraps (which came with 3) and calamari were perfect! The lettuce wraps had kalua pork, BBQ sauce, and pickled red onions. The kalua pork was very flavorful and juicy! I've been to many places where the kalua pork is overlooked and dried out, but Kimo's really cooked it perfection! The calamari featured rather large fried calamari steaks and a great sauce with a little bit of a horseradish kick. 

The Ocean front deck in the bar is hard to beat! The view is fantastic, and in the evening the sound of the waves is very relaxing - it definitely has that text book beach vacation vibe. However, be aware that if you sit along the railing you will probably get wet, and little crabs may venture their way under your table. We didn't mind the Ocean spray as it was hot outside when we were dining! 

The only downside of Kimo's is that it's a little pricey. However, I don't think there is such thing as a cheap meal in Lahaina! If you like sweets give the Hula Pie a try, it's famous across all of their restaurants and it does not disappoint!",Becky Y.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating
5/23/2017,3.0 star rating,"I asked one local gentleman from Lahaina where he would go with his family and Kimo's is what he showed us on the map.

Great location. The outside deck practically on the ocean with the waves crashing under you.

The service was very good. It was quick and friendly.

We ordered the macadamia crusted Calamari. I was waiting all day for this. Just sounded terrific. My husband ordered a local IPA. It was 'mild' in flavor compared to most IPAs. Didn't have much of a hoppy influence. I had the happy hour lemonade. Too sweet for me. I had to squeeze the lemons into it that came with the Calamari to settle the sweetness.

My husband was very disappointed in the Calamari dish. It was over fried and he ended up taking most of the breading off. He said he gives the Calamari 1.5 stars. I would give it two. I did like the steak finger style servings but the crust lacked flavor. 

We were going to order other drinks but my husband thought we should go elsewhere. 

One a good note, but not for us, we saw an awesome burger go to the next table. Medium Rare. My mouth is watering as I write this. Even though we did not have a burger I would recommend it over the Calamari.",Jane V.,"Newberg, OR",4.0 star rating
9/13/2017,5.0 star rating,"I emailed Yelp corporate offices early yesterday to see if they could add a 6th star to their scoring model as this restaurant deserves an extra star, but I've yet to hear back from them.

I'm not one who throws around 5 star reviews as a dining experience has to have it all to warrant the TOP rating.  Food, service, ambiance.  Our recent dinner at Kimo's hit 5 stars on all 3 counts!

All fish they serve are in season out of respect for the ocean. I dig this.  I had Parmesan crusted red snapper.  This was the single BEST seafood dish I've had in my entire life.  I'm not kidding.  My wife has the Mahi Mahi ""Kimo's style"" and she loved her dish.  

We paired these with a couple amazing Kimo's mai tais and finished our meal with their famous Kimo's hula pie.  If they had these where I life in CA I would end up being a cast member on ""My 600 pound life"" before you know it.

We sat outside with the Pacific Ocean about 10 yards from our table.   We witnessed the gorgeous Maui sunset.  Scotty our server was courteous, knowledgeable and cool.  6 star meal!",Michael Q.,"Ventura, CA",4.0 star rating
9/10/2017,2.0 star rating,"It's a tourist place, so you know you're going to pay more than it's worth. However, our $17.50 Seared Ahi Salad was so meager, we just stared at it a second and laughed. The ahi amounts to about a 1"" cube cut into slices. Otherwise, it was pretty boring cabbage with not much flavor from the dressing. The burger we had was decent and the fries were great. The service was friendly and the seating right on the water was beautiful so we enjoyed ourselves in spite of the lackluster food. At $50 for mediocre food and two iced teas, we won't be back.",Colin S.,"Palm Springs, CA",4.0 star rating
9/18/2017,4.0 star rating,Wonderful place for a nicer dinner. Great cocktails. Our waiter was very helpful guiding us through the menu.

5/17/2017,5.0 star rating,"We had a reservation and were seated on the top deck. We requested for a seat on the lower deck by the water and our server was kind enough to find us a table. 
Food was delicious! We started off with the coconut shrimp which was amazing. For the mains we had the ribs and lobster topped Mahi Mahi. I devoured the ribs in no time. Fish was good and the rice with it was excellent. 
Service was prompt and the views were excellent. The place seemed full, make sure to get a reservation to avoid waiting.",Leon L.,"Redwood City, CA",4.0 star rating
8/4/2017,5.0 star rating,"Our favorite meal thus far on Maui. What a ""hidden gem"". None of my wife and I's friends who have been to Maui had tried this place and some people we'd met around the resort we were staying at (The Grand Wailea) had heard of it. However, at our concierge's suggestion, we decided to give Kimo's a chance.

I had the Kimo's Style Fish. That day's catch was a local snapper-type fish (I forgot the name). Unfortunately, as we dined late, that fish was sold out for the day. The server suggested trying the Maui Maui cooked the same style as the Snapper I was going to order, and I figured ""why not?"".

Boy, was I surprised. It was one of the best fish entree's I've ever had. Not only the fish, but the accompanied flavorful asparagus as we'll as the mildly-spiced rice accompanied the Mahi Fish Filet perfectly.

My wife ordered the lobster, and although I only had a bite of her's, it definitely gave my meal a run for it's money.

A+. If you're visiting Maui, don't leave without making a dinner reservation here.",Joe A.,"Rochester Hills, MI",4.0 star rating
7/19/2017,4.0 star rating,"Kimo's Maui is a perfect date night spot. Not only do you have a fabulous view of the ocean, the atmosphere is fun and romantic without being stuffy. I would highly suggest making reservations but if not, have a seat at the bar while you wait for a table and enjoy amazing cocktails, an appetizer to share (coconut shrimp, please!!) and a gorgeous view of the ocean. The Pacific Paradise is my favorite drink on the menu (who doesn't love a fruity rum filled drink while dining on the beach?) though you can't go wrong with the classic Mai Tai either. Finally, make sure to save room for dessert - their original hula pie is wickedly decadent and a treat your taste buds will worship you for.",Kait C.,"Wailuku, HI",4.0 star rating
8/20/2017,5.0 star rating,"Great food, excellent service and a wonderful view!

The Mrs. And I came here for dinner approximately 30 minutes before sunset (1830). We were greeted by friendly staff and seated upstairs on the deck. The view up there was nice, but not quite as nice as downstairs by the ocean. Fortunately, they opened up the tarp screens upstairs, which improved our view. 

My wife and I start with drinks, the lava flow and the mango colada. Both were delicious! As an appetizer, we started with the poke & avocado stack. We can't go to Hawaii without getting poke, right? It was an excellent starter!

The server was incredibly knowledgeable about fish and greatly helped us narrow down our selection, as we both wanted seafood, but did not know exactly which entrée we wanted. We ended up getting the ""coconut crusted,"" which was the marlin, and the ""lobster topped,"" which used a fish that I can't remember the name of. The marlin had a firm texture, but very sweet flesh.The lobster was much softer, and flakier, with a savory lobster crust. Both were great tasting in their own way, and both came with a delicious side of carrots/broccoli.

We enjoyed our dinner, but unfortunately, we were too full for their signature hula pie. Perhaps we will try this next time

As a tip, I would recommend making reservations scheduled approximately 30 minutes before sunset, and request to be seated by the water downstairs if possible, so that you can enjoy it while seated by the ocean.",Erwin K.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
9/6/2017,2.0 star rating,"It's pretty unfortunate that I had to give such a low rating but this is according to my friends experience who I dined in with. We've heard great things about Kimo being from Oahu and having Duke's here and Duke's is phenomenal. 

However, our experience there were not the same as Dukes. My friend ordered the steak and the steak was only the size of a baby's fist (I am not joking. I can post a picture later if needed) and he only received maybe six pieces of potato wedges. In order words the steak and fries were not worth the near 40$. My other friend received her dish and she was lacking vegetables and said the flavor itself was not good and the rice was soggy and disgusting (same as my dish). The other friend said her chicken that she ordered was good at the beginning but the flavors itself was not even distributed and the bottom lacked flavor. 


As for my experience, my dish was pretty spot on and our waitress was nice and friendly; however, I felt as if she saw how displease we were and didn't make any effort to see what was wrong. Being an employee at a 4.5 star restaurant we are taught how to understand another persons displeasures through body language and find a way to see if there's anything we can do to make it better. And again there was a lack of veggies and the rice was not appetizing... honestly it may have killed my appetite when I was eating. 

Overall, the two stars were given because of the waitress friendly demeanor at the beginning and the quick sitting.",David K.,"Honolulu, HI",4.0 star rating

9/16/2017,5.0 star rating,"I understand this place has 2000 reviews. However I wanted to leave one because (besides the amazing food) our waiter was amazing. His name was Kimo. He was super nice and personable. Sadly he was having to deal with a table next to ours that seemed to be complaining too much and getting stuff for free. Kimo stayed professional with us.  He made our anniversary dinner perfect. 
Obviously. The food was amazing. Everything came out fast and tasted amazing. The drinks were fancy and delicious. We came in knowing how great the food and drinks would be here. But Kimo really made the night special.

Both dishes were delightful. For entrees we had the coconut crusted fish of the day and filet mignon. The fish was covered in a peanut Thai sauce and fresh pineapple salsa which complimented each other perfectly. The sides were rice and seasonal veggies. The filet came out a perfect medium rare as ordered, the sides were a fresh kale salad and potato wedges. The dish was seasoned perfectly and covered in a sweet potato purée. If that isn't enough.. we enjoyed a piece of hula pie.. which was possibly the greatest thing in the world.

I had the special Fish Tacos - a little spicy, super fresh fish, creamy aioli, crispy fresh cabbage - best on Maui! Several friends had other fresh fish dishes for the day that were just as tasty! One of our group had to send her dish back to the kitchen and also had service issues - therefore, the review was marked down from what would have been a 5 to a 4. On the second trip, we sat in the bar area - open seating and we picked a spot close to the water. Again, food was fantastic - I had the Fish Tacos once again!

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the food, how it was sourced, and provided us with recommendations based on what we liked. Even though we took a while to order, we never felt like we had to track him down to get an order placed.

I also appreciated the bar waitress who walked around taking drink orders. They came out timely and were so delicious. I'd recommend the Lava Flow with our without alcohol :) 

As for the food, everything was amazing, delicious, and fresh. I ordered the tofu dish (although I eat meat) thinking it would be a lighter option. Not only was it filling but the flavors hit all the right notes. We also ordered the pork lettuce wraps which were equally as tasty and one the fresh fish dishes.

8/25/2017,5.0 star rating,"Took my wife here for our anniversary based on all the great reviews on Yelp. Was not disappointed. 

A quick note on the layout. If you are in a large group for dinner, you should expect to be seated further back from the patio / water. 

The upstairs seating configuration is mostly 2 tops along the rail with great sunset views. The downstairs seating is mostly 4-tops along the rail of the patio.

If you happen to get seated upstairs for a sunset dinner, be aware that they have awnings and shade cloth to keep guests from getting too hot. Fear not! About 20 minutes before sunset, the staff will retract the awning and shade cloth so you can have an unobstructed view.

Food? Very good. Had the catch of the day and loved the preparation. My only complaint is that the asparagus was slightly underdone for my taste.

-Ambiance - A. I like the seating area on the main deck - very relaxed and amazing views of the sunset
-Service - B+.  Very accommodating of any requests and substitutions on the menu 
-Food - B+. Flavors were pretty good but the portion size on the smaller side esp on the fish dishes for what you pay.  Menu is a bit confusing. I had the shrimp pappardelle which contained about 5 decent sized shrimp.

7/6/2017,4.0 star rating,"After a very long day of hiking and walking and sightseeing and burning off a million and two calories, we were ready for a killer mud pie.  So, of course, Yelp here we come.
We were close to Kimo's by then so we stopped.  I figured no way at 5:30pm could we get in just for a dessert as the wait for dinner was over an hour.  We walked in and were told we could sit at a ""bar table"" and walked right in!  The bar tables are on the same patio as the dining tables and it was beautiful, right on their lanai, right on the water.  What a beautiful setting.  

I also ordered the kalua pork lettuce wraps pupu, which were great.  Great bbq sauce, a mound of kalua pork.  Pretty healthy, right?

Now bring on the good stuff.... mmmm Hula Pie.  Great stuff.   Mac nut ice cream, oreo crust, chocolate fudge.  And only 1800 calories!   (eek).

We'd definitely get it again. But despite how good the Marlin was the bone in prime rib was about the best we've ever had. Perfect medium rare with a Texas sear on the outside. Over the top good.

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, which was plenty for 2 to share because it had 2 large pieces of fried chicken inside. It came with French fries which were very good. The burger had a nice sauce kick to it because of the aioli sauce. Would recommended any chicken lover to get this dish.

My wife ordered a salad which was actually pretty large, I had the fish and chips which was about $20, and was a child size portion...literally 3 finger size pieces of fish.

We ordered an appetizer with a hummus type dip and they included barely enough pita bread for one person, we asked for another piece and they obliged...and charged for it.  

Anyway the food was good but not special. we had a $35 lunch with kid size drinks and food and it was over $70.  There are better places everywhere around here.

The chicken was cooked well.  Skewered and doused in teriyaki.  It sauce was sweet and the coleslaw and rice was a good complement to the meal.

8/29/2016,4.0 star rating,"I usually just come to Kimo's for their famous Hula Pie but this time we did a late lunch, which definitely impressed. 

I had the chopped chicken salad which was one of my top salads of the summer. It had delicious smoky applewood bacon and fried chickpeas that contrasted so well with fresh edamame and asian pear. The chicken was grilled fine but it to me was not the star of the show and I was okay with that enjoying all of the mix-ins dressed in a tasty buttermilk dressing. The actual romaine though looked like it was prepared very early that morning and was starting to brown a little bit at the ends, but it wasn't wilted. I would order the salad again because it was flavorful and filling without making me feel gross. We also ordered roasted vegetable salad and the clear star was Maui's surfing goat cheese, so tangy yet smooth and balanced. The ahi poke and tuna stack was also well-done. Poke super fresh and the avocado at the perfect consistency to serve. I was very impressed with the food overall!

But the best, BEST thing about Kimo's is their Hula Pie! A heaping portion of macadamia nut ice cream sits atop a dense oreo cookie crust and is covered in chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The ice cream is loaded with lightly toasted mac nuts. It's special from its dramatic presentation and for being on a special plate with special sporks. A spork is the way to go. It's a great Maui dessert and I encourage it to be a tradition. Kimo's also wants it to be a tradition and after dining there once, you can receive a free slice of Hula pie if you return and have two entrees if you bring back the first receipt. It's worth it if you are in the area!",Emily P.,"Oakland, CA",4.0 star rating
6/26/2017,5.0 star rating,"Came here with the BF about a month ago for date night while on vacation and it was perfect. We were able to snag a table right around 6ish before it got too crazy and had a great view of the ocean/sunset. That particular day had some pretty bad tide/waves crashing in so they had to take out tables closest to the water that were in the ""splash zone"". That particular area is great for capturing the perfect sunset photo. The drinks were amazing, we had the lava flow, mango colada and mango mojito. All of them were fresh, tangy and sweet and packed an alcoholic punch. The food was even better. I ordered the mahi mahi topped with lobster and my bf ordered their house special mahi mahi and both dishes were the best mahi mahi we have ever had. Seriously it will ruin other mahi mahi for you! We also ordered the poke/avocado dish as an appetizer. I thought the poke was so fresh and light and didn't taste too fishy. I'm not usually the biggest fan of poke (my bf loves it) but I really enjoyed this appetizer and recommend. I would not recommend the brussel sprouts/potatoe hash side unfortunately. It came out more as a salad than a hash and not nearly enough brussel sprouts so that was slightly disappointing. Other than that our experience was great and the service was friendly, quick and attentive. They also had live music towards the end of our dinner going into the rest of the evening, super fun! We were both very happy after dining here and would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Maui.",Alex S.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

It's among the best I've had on island (and that's saying a lot), and their Mai Tai's are top notch. They have a great happy hour as well.

6/25/2017,3.0 star rating,"20 plus years ago, I went to Kimo's for the first time.  Then, it was all about the ambiance, views, drinks and the Hula Pie.  Fast forward to my retirement years and I made it a priority to return to Kimo's.  I can't say that it was a disappointment but I will say that my tastes have refined over the years.  Let me explain.

This is one of the best locations to watch the sunset.  The lower area looks right out over the ocean with an open air decor.  If you are lucky enough to get a seat down below on the beach side of the restaurant, you can't ask for a nicer open-air restaurant ocean view in Lahaina.  It is so pretty, great ambiance, a gorgeous bar and nice drinks.  

As I mentioned before, this was my first time actually eating at Kimo's.  The food is good and tasty but don't expect a 5-star meal.  Take it for what it is--a local eatery with the usual island entrees of fish, teriyaki courses, steaks, burgers etc....  I ordered the Kushiyaki and enjoyed it very much.  The meat was tender and the flavors fresh.  My husband ordered the special of Moonfish with a citrus-herb sauce.  The first couple bites were moist, tender and delicious but as he continued, the flesh lost its moist texture.  He did love the citrus-herb sauce that accompanied it but there just wasn't enough of it on the plate to have on every bite.  To finish, I ordered the Hula Pie to see if it was as delicious as I had remembered and it didn't disappoint.  Chocolate cookie crust filled with macadamia ice cream and topped with roasted macadamia nuts, hot fudge and whipped cream--what's not to like, right?!  

Would I go back again?  Well, if my husband wasn't with me and I was with a younger or less of a foodie group, I wouldn't baulk if the choice was to dine at Kimo's.  If I was with my husband, probably not because of two reasons.  Number one, he wasn't impressed and number 2, we have so many more restaurants to try that are on our ""must try"" list.  

This is a great 20-40's restaurant and bar that I do believe you will enjoy if you aren't expecting a 4 or 5 star meal.",R W.,"Boise, ID",4.0 star rating

The host that brought us to our table was very friendly and even accommodated us by moving us over a little so I could be out of direct sunlight.

We had been at the beach all day and were tired and dehydrated, so we stuck with water. The waiter and other wait staff kept our glasses full the entire time we were there. My husband ordered the prime rib medium rare and I ordered the Parmesan crusted Ono. 

The food came out and my husbands prime rib was way over cooked. We let the waiter know and he came back pretty quickly with a new plate, which was cooked perfectly. My Ono was amazing. The flavors went so well together and I truly enjoyed every bite.

For dessert we had the famous Hula pie. It was very good and definitely worth having.

The appetizer of roasted tomatoes with fresh goat ch cheese and basil flat bread was truly amazing. You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes and herbs. 

For main course I went with the lobster topped preparation and it did not disappoint. Was served with fresh veggies and rice pilaf, all of which were perfectly cooked. The fish was flaky and moist everything you expect in a good fish dish.

The first table that we were shown to was right in that area, and when we were leaving to go to another table, we got sprayed by a crashing wave.

They seated us by the water and sent my granddaughter a hula pie for her Bday! We all ordered a different fish so we could share and coincidentally we each ordered our favorite! I had the traditional mojito and ended up ordering one more! Yum! With reservations we had no wait!

Overall, the food is very good but not amazing. The tuna avocado stack and beef rib appetizers are excellent. The fish tacos entrée is ok. Although the fish is fresh, it was cooked a little dry.

* prime rib - decent
* hula pie - so yummy, I had to literally walk away to stop eating it.

We didn't have reservations, but were seated after only 20 minutes (which wasn't too bad & totally worth the wait).

Now the food.  Wow, wow, wow, I didn't know fish could taste so good.  I had the mahi-mahi Kimo style one day and the opah ""lobster topped"" the second night.  Both were EXCELLENT.  I didn't leave anything on my plate both times.  Fiance had the opah one night & prime rib the second night.  Also excellent.  You have to get the hula pie for dessert as well.

I also changed out the rice side for a baked potato and it was delish! 

Where they go wrong is they give you tasty warm bread and carrot muffins at the table. The warm bread and butter was great while waiting for my meal and the carrot muffin was a perfect dessert. I totally would have ordered and paid for dessert but why bother when I have this yummy basically carrot cake cupcake minus the icing. I mean thank you and hubby says thank you too because he isn't a sweet tooth and doesn't like waiting for me to eat dessert and coffee.

4/12/2016,4.0 star rating,"SUPER ono! I was with some friends and we were hungry. Hopped on Yelp to figure out somewhere to to eat. Kimo's was within the general area so we figured we'd check it out.

It was around 1:30 on a Sunday and lunch rush was just fizzling down. They sat us promptly at a table in the shade. I was really hoping to get a true ""ocean side"" dining experience so as soon as I saw a chance, I asked the waiter if we could move. They were more than happy to accommodate us. He sat us at our table and our new waitress was not even close to as friendly as he was. She was moving things quickly along for table rotation, I get it. I used to work in the industry. It's just good practice to not let your customers know this... and it was obvious. Moving on... 

I was really craving a burger so I HAD to have Da Hawaiian... Grilled pineapple, red onion, swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and beef... YES.

It wasn't long before the food was out and I didn't know what to do with this monstrosity of a burger. It. Was. HUGE. I actually laughed because I didn't know how to eat it!  (TIP: Not a ""first date"" meal selection. Save it for when you don't care how much food is on your face. That's all I'm saying.)

6/19/2017,5.0 star rating,"Prepare for a long wait or make a reservation ahead of time if you want to eat at Kimo's.

My boyfriend and I came here based off of his dad's recommendation and it was delicious. We easily made a reservation on Open Table beforehand and were lucky enough to get a table right on the water right in view of the ocean and live music show that night. Willie K was the musical performance that night and he was amazing!

My boyfriend ordered the Baked ""Kimo's Style"" with the fresh local caught fish that came with that ( I am unfortunately unable to remember the specific fish him and I got). His fish was amazing and melted in or mouths. The seasoning was perfect and he devoured his entire plate which is rare to say for my boyfriend. He says it was the best meal he has had in Maui. He also ordered Kimo's Mai Tai which was delicious and got a refill of. My boyfriend immensely loved his dish and drink which, like I said before, is very rare for him!

I ordered the Parmesan crusted dish which was also delicious. If you like your fish a little rough this is the dish to get. The fish, however, was the highlight of my dish. I was not a fan of my sides but that was most likely a me issue since my boyfriend enjoyed eating them for me. I would probably get a salad next time we came for my side.

We got Kimo's Original Hula Pie to finish our meal off and it was delicious but also huge! It probably would have been better to split it between four people rather than two. However, it was nice to slowly eat while watching the musical performance which in my opinion is what made the meal overall fantastic for me. 

I would definitely come again and recommend this place for fish lovers since their fish is excellent! I would probably order my food a little differently but my boyfriend says he would do it exactly as is. If you cannot decide on what to get don't be afraid to ask the server for recommendations because they were very helpful. Also, be prepared for a pricey bill, especially if you plan on ordering drinks.",Malisa D.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating
10/25/2016,5.0 star rating,"First of all our server Ryan was great. He was friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable right away. Did a great job of explaining the menu thoroughly and giving his own recommendations while somehow still being quick and efficient. All other staff encountered were also very friendly. 

The house bread was just what you want it to be, flaky on the outside, warm and soft on the inside and seasoned nicely. We tried the calamari which was just okay. Heavily breaded which gave it a nice crunchiness but the taste was a little bland, even with the cocktail sauce. Would have gone with the coconut shrimp if I could do it again. Despite the restaurant being near capacity, our entrees came out soon after ordering, and were both amazing. I had the opakapaka done Kimo's style. The fish was baked just right, tender and moist, but the real treat is the garlic-lemon-basil glaze which I really cant say enough about. It made the dish so flavorful without being overpowering. While so many other things on the menu looked tempting I would honestly have to give real consideration to getting this again if we went back. The wife had lobster-topped mahi which she loved as well. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Warm and cozy with relaxing oceanfront views. The lighting gets a little dim after sundown which was fine for us and actually added to the ambiance but you might have trouble with the menu if your eyes struggle at night. The tables and chairs are a little close together but that is to be fully expected with this restaurant's location in ""downtown"" Lahaina. They had live music which is not an uncommon occurrence for the area but still always a nice touch.

Lunch was great and I have always been addicted to the great Caesar salad here, and the serve the freshest fish in town. The cant miss items are The Hula Pie and a fresh Kimo's T-Shirt.

Cold beers and a nice selection of wine suited us just fine, but of course there is a full bar and beautiful tropical drinks.

The food was good and the fish was cooked to perfection. Their Hula pie was over hyped and I did not find anything special about it. It was basically a big slice of ice cream with chocolate drizzled on top with crushed macadamia nuts and the ice cream had no flavor. You could probably skip on dessert here and head down Front street to find ice cream or shaved ice elsewhere. Public parking and expect to pay at least $10 for 2 hours.

The appetizer was great and I highly recommend that. The ahi was very fresh. The Marlin was a 7 out of 10 but the undercooked buttered string beans that came with it was only ok. The prime rib was decent. A little tough to cut, but when I asked for medium rare they delivered that correctly. The au juis could be mor flavorful too.

The view was spectacular, we got a table right on the railing as the sun was starting to head down. It was perfection. The staff was great, our waitress for the night was prompt and took our drink order right away. She explained their fresh fish options, it can be a little confusing without explanation. We ordered the Mac crusted calamari as an app. It was some of the best calamari I've had, super tender and fresh. You could literally cut it with your knife. For our entrees my wife ordered the shrimp parparadelle(forgive my spelling), I went with the Onaga(red snapper) special. Both were super delicious, the fish was super fresh and was flaky and delicious.

7/10/2017,3.0 star rating,"We had a good time at Kimo's for a sunday night dinner barring some glaring faults.  The good: Most of the food was very good.  Highly suggest the fresh fish options.  Kimo style fish was very good (Opa) with the right amount of spices and cooked to perfection.  And the hostess was gracious enough to find one of the very best seats in the house for our family of four.  
Here are the knocks: We waited 25 minutes BEFORE we had our order taken.  That starts off any meal with a negative vibe and really didn't apologize or acknowledge the long wait.  The place is huge and quite a production.  Like a well oiled machine, we were passed to many people throughout the night, from the host, to the table guide, to the drink taker, to the waiter to the busboy.  I'm sure its necessary but lacks the intimacy of something you would expect in the spirit of Hawaii.  The Shrimp Pappaderelle pasta was much too rich either from excessive amounts of butter and/or salt.  The lighting was very dim and hard to read the menu.  And the kicker, 12 oz pint glasses!  Is it really that much of a splurge to have a 16 oz pint of draft beer for $8?  Of course this place is quite pricey but average for the location.
I am sure Kimo's in its heyday was a great find when Maui was less populated 20 years ago, but now its so big and well known, we'll be searching for the next Kimo's down the road.",Sir C.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating
8/21/2016,4.0 star rating,"It was a nice Hawaiian dinner night out at Kimo's last night for our family. It was our second time here; and, although prices are high the seafood is pretty fresh. We had a table in the outdoor seating area right by the water and were able to enjoy the sound of the water crashing, the lights from the party boats out in the distance and the night breeze.  

Kimo's is great for families with small children, more intimate adult dinners, large families, etc. It's good for any type of party.  There's a nice selection of all types of food.
We started with the Coconut Shrimp app which was fresh and consisted of large shrimp on a Panko encrusted toasted coconut flakes.   My husband felt the crust was a bit thick but good regardless.

Last time my husband had the prime rib for $49.  It was good but not memorable but then you don't come to Hawaii for steak right?  He did try it bc the waiter told us it was one of their best. 

This time my husband had the Baked Kimo's Style fish (Opakapaka, a pink Hawaiian snapper fish) recommended by our server Will and it was very fresh and tasty.  It was a good size portion but still a bit high at $31. 

My older son had a Chicken Caesar Salad, the dressing was nicely salted and had a nice hint of anchovies. 

I had the Roasted Beet Salad which was good, but a very small portion, and confused me a bit bc it really was an arugula salad with beets not a beet salad as stated on menu.    I really wanted more beets.  The goat cheese and pear on it were nice. 

I had the Tuna Poke app as my meal bc I didn't want something so big, but it was actually a pretty large portion. I only had half of it.  It was well-seasoned and the fried tortilla corn chips were great!  I did wish the guacamole under the poke was less mushy and colder.  When I think of poke I think of a refreshing cold dish and it wasn't exactly so for me.  

My little son had the fried chicken with steamed vegetables off the kids menu.  I didn't taste the chicken but he seemed to enjoy the little cute fried chicken balls.  

We ended with the much raved about Hula Pie which is basically a huge ice cream sandwich with whipped cream.  It's not my thing but the boys liked it.

However the biggest disappointment of the evening was towards what they're ""supposedly"" known for, their prime rib. Being big steak fans, my entire family decided to order the prime rib. Each of us were disappointed, as all of our prime ribs were tough, fatty, and grizzly; not at all what they should have been. The mashed potatoes and carrots that accompanied the meal were average, nothing really special about them. The best part of the meal was the side sweet potato and Brussel sprout hash; that was fantastic. Overall, not a bad place for dinner; however there are many other places to choose.",Ian C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
3/17/2016,4.0 star rating,"We stopped in a bit late, just for dessert & cocktails. We were promptly seated, a party of 5. We were seated up stairs, the restaurant was busy and live. Music the whole works. The staff seemed very busy, as it was right before the kitchen closed. 

    It took about 30 minutes to be acknowledged. We actually weren't super upset. We were visiting with friends and enjoying the atmosphere. We had asked for a server several times. Again, we were too busy chatting to notice the extreme delay. It was finally noticed that we had not been helped. Our server, a man, James I believe, was very kind. He was very apologetic for any inconvenience. He promptly got our drinks and desserts. He then offered to comp the dessert. He kept apologizing. We told him it was okay. 

    He then got the manager involved and made her aware of the situation. She came out and addressed the issue. We again told her we were fine. She then comped our whole bill! We were not expecting that at all. She just wanted to make sure we were happy. She said she didn't want to lose any customers and hopes we that we will return in the future. 

    We didn't eat entrees, but we would def return based on the good customer service alone. I was very impressed with the concern of the server and the manager alike. I found this to be very good business practice and showing genuine concern for customer contentment.",Krista B.,"Hayward, CA",4.0 star rating

Avoid if you want to have a pleasant evening. 


The service at Kimo's leaves a lot to be desired. As it was my Mothers birthday my family and I made a reservation at Kimo's for 6pm. At 5:52 we arrived and were given a buzzer and we were made wait another 10/15mins. Also the host was annoyed that we were ""early"". As it was a busy place we didn't mind too much and the host was apologetic for the delay. Our server was the true downfall of the evening, when she served us our drinks she informed us the legs of the table were broken and the solution to this was just to tell us not to lean on the table.(No option to change tables was offered) Upon making the reservation we asked to be seated with a view of the sunset... we were seated in a corner, like naughty children. 
When our appetizers arrived our server informed us she had dropped one of the shrimp and would bring us another, she literally brought a plate with one single shrimp, I understand she dropped one but for the inconvenience I expected a little more. Speaking from experience as a server that is what I would have done. 
AVOID the Calamari!!
As I am not 21 (I'm 20)I did not order an alcoholic beverage but my Mum allowed me to take a sip of her drink, our server came over to the table and said ""Can you refrain from drinking that as Hawaii has strict liquor laws"" I understood but her tone was really rude and condescending. As a visitor I was unaware, to my knowledge if you're parents consent to you sipping their beer then that is ok. A better tone and approach to this situation would have enhanced my visit. 
The food was delicious but for the price that was being asked for I would have expected to be treated better. Throughout the meal while refilling waters our server continued to splash me which might have been accidental I don't know but it was not pleasant. As we got to the end of our meal there was a couple behind us looking for service and we made this known to our server and she acknowledged that and just walked back to the kitchen, the couple were not helped for another 10mins. I assume since it was not her table. 
At Kimo's they sing for you if it is your birthday and when this happened it was ingenious and awkward. They wanted it to be over as fast and as soon as possible. Then it came to the bill, she gave us one free dessert (for my mother's birthday) and then we had a voucher for another free dessert our server took it upon herself to decide that we were only allowed to have one free dessert.

We made 7:30pm reservations and requested an ocean view table, arrived a little early and decided an indoor table was OK since we could be sat immediately. (Approaching hangry stage!) We were greeted by a server and served some water while we perused the cocktail menu. Then the hostess appeared and offered us a better table overlooking the deck and beach... appreciated the extra effort and fresh air! 

Complimentary bread and banana muffins were delicious, as were our Lahaina Lemonade and Lava Flow cocktails! Fish of the day was mahi-mahi, my husband had it prepared with lobster salad on top while I ordered the ""Baked Kimo's Style."" Both were very enjoyable, served with rice and sautéed vegetables.

We got no refills on water and that hasn't happened to me in a long time. I've came to think that maybe they charge for refills on water? 
Also they could not even pronounce the food on their own menu properly even after I ordered the item lol, maybe the server was new or thought I did not know what I was talking about.

The lava flows here are the best in all of Maui! I got the coconut shrimp and a side of the most amazing Brussel sprout sweet potato hash. My husband got the filet minion that was cooked perfectly! Our waitress was the sweetest and checked in with us every couple minutes! They also have great bread rolls and carrot cake muffins. 
We didn't save room for the famous hula pie but had it last time we visited kimo's! I'm not a big dessert person but the hula pie is also probably the best in Maui! 
Note to visitors-The people in the parking lots hustle you for scuba diving all those activities. They stop you for a good 10 minutes and you basically have to run away or they won't stop talking to you. We took a uber to avoid that situation.

Undoubtedly, first things first, get reservations as it fills up fast. Appetizers are spot on, tasty little preparations each with their own flavorful taste, and large enough for a big table to split. Lovely drink menu with many classics + twists on classics + fun tropical concoctions. 

We've only gotten seafood main dishes here, and ever single one has been sooooo satisfying. Fish is beautifully prepared (several options depending on which fish you choose, like Mac nut breaded, fancy grilles/baked options), and the fish itself is fresh and mouth-watering savory. Seriously, I'm getting super hungry just writing this review. Rice and a side of veggies comes with every meal. 

Dessert... Hula pie. Don't question whether or not you should get it - just do. Just get the slice of massive vanilla mac nut idea cream, creamy delicious chocolate fudge icing with oreo crust.

12/24/2016,5.0 star rating,"A really lovely location on Front Street with a water front view. Make sure to make reservations. I would recommend giving them a call to make the reservation as opposed to going through open table. I called the day of to make dinner reservations and they were very accommodating. Parking can be tough to find so make sure to give yourself a little extra time.

We had a 6:45pm reservation time and were quickly seated. We ordered the Kimos Style Mahi mahi, the roast chicken with cheesy polenta, shrimp pappardelle, and the coconut encrusted monchong (a firm white fish). All were very good and the portions were big, especially compared to mamas fish house. My two favorites were the Kimos style mahi mahi and the coconut monchong. The shrimp papardelle was a little weird in the sense that it was not a super traditional method of making papardelle but it was good nevertheless with a good amount of shrimp. We also got a side of the Brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes which was yummy but small (only enough for two people to share).

The ginger mojito was good and a generous pour. The pina colada was very sweet and we questioned if there was even alcohol in it. I'm still not sure if they forgot to put the rum in, but a yummy drink nonetheless. 

Our server was sweet and attentive! We were well taken care of. 

The hula pie was a little hyped up. One slice definitely big enough to share with a large family but I was disappointed with the quality of the macadamia ice cream. If you want really good macadamia ice cream, then go to Ululanis shave ice (five min walk from Kimos) and get the best macadamia ice cream ever at the bottom of your shave ice. But! Kimo's will give you a free slice of hula pie if you call ahead and inform them of a birthday in your party

The menu lists about 10 preparations: coconut crusted,  Kimo's baked, citrus glazed, etc. and you may order any fish any style, but we went with the chef's recommendations. We also tried a hula pie.

We took advantage of their HH specials in the bar/lounge patio until it came time for our reservation. Pretty good drink specials and I saw they had a special bar menu too for bites.

When we got our table, it was located upstairs overlooking the ocean and a perfect view of the sunset. Our waitress, Ina, was such a sweetheart. She hit every aspect of a wonderful waitress for us. Food was delicious and plentiful. i ordered the Pork Ribs and it was more than enough. Ina made sure that my plate contained no dairy and even substituted some of the sides so that I could eat everything.

7/10/2017,3.0 star rating,"I'd give this about 31/2 stars. Everything started out great. We made our reservation the day-of, they sat us right away, our table was upstairs with a beautiful ocean view. The server was nice and they have bar servers that come around to take empty drinks and refill (great idea!). 
We checked this place out on yelp before we came so we new what we were ordering immediately. Our server got our drink order, apps and entree all in the same visit to our table.
We ordered the macadamia crusted calamari, clam chowder, and Caesar salad to split for starters. I highly recommend the calamari! It comes in strips and was cooked perfectly, and the macadamia crust is the way to go. We also tried the original mai tai and the Alii mai tai. We both agreed we actually liked the original best. The difference between the Alii and the original is the Alii has spiced rum and a different mixture of juices. I thought I'd like it more, as I enjoy spiced rum, but the original had better juices.
At this point we really though this would be a 5-star spot. Food & drinks = great Service = fast an efficient View/Ambiance = casual romantic. But it was as if we had jinxed it. 
We had decided to split the prime rib entree (since we ordered so many apps) and get a ""side"" of lobster tail added on. We ordered medium rare and again, had ordered it from the beginning along with our drinks and apps. It was about another 25 minutes or so before it showed up after we finished eating our apps. When it did show up, the server was nice enough to actually split it into 2 plates for us along with the side of veggies and mashed potatoes. But it was like we got separate halves of 2 different pieces of meat! Mine was the fattier end but was cooked to a perfect medium rare, super juicy and tender. My husbands was the more meaty half but was a solid well done with no pink and was drier, tough, and lacked salt. When he took a bite and seemed unhappy we eat tried each other's and it seriously seemed as if we were eating two different cuts of prime rib. The lobster tail was also extremely over cooked, dry, and lacked any flavor even after I drenched it in butter and lemon.
We decided not to complain because it had taken so long for it to come out in the first place and didn't want to sit waiting longer. 
It was almost as if the server knew what he had served us because he avoided the ""how was everything"" question and wouldn't look us in the eye anymore. He had done a great job for the most part but obviously didn't want to mention where anything went wrong on their end. Not even a ""sorry the food took so long to come out"".
Unfortunately the entree made us take a turn to our review. When you're paying the money you pay for food out here you can't sit down with a well done prime rib that you ordered med rare and strongly overdone lobster and wait for it when you ordered it an hour ahead.
I don't believe this would happen to us every time we ate here seeing how great the reviews are and seeing that they are ""known for their prime rib"" but again, with how expensive it is to eat on this island I wouldn't risk coming back and dropping $150 on a meal that wasn't good.",cj l.,"Newbury Park, CA",4.0 star rating

1/7/2016,5.0 star rating,"Walk through the unassuming entrance off of Front Street to a lovely upstairs and downstairs oceanfront setting. At dinner there is a full menu with chicken, prime rib, fish, salads, or the casual menu with more pupus, drinks, burger, and more. Unless you go early for dinner (say, 5 pm), reservations are a good idea.

My friend and I shared the pork ribs off the casual menu, under pupus. Considering this is not a BBQ joint they did a good job. The meat was moist and fell off the bones. I especially appreciated that the sauce was not overly sweet, as it is in many places. I had the burger, which came with fries. It was not spectacular, but it was good. It was also quite large. My friend had the wedge salad with bleu cheese dressing and a small steak. She's had it before and enjoyed it enough to order it again. She also enjoyed the ma tai she ordered that came in a kitschy glass.

We shared the Hula Pie for dessert. Comes with a special Hula Pie spork for conquering the mountain. Should not be allowed by law. Just see the accompanying photo, and you'll understand right away.

Kids will love running to the railing and looking at the ocean. There's a kiddie menu. Adults will enjoy a frosty beverage of their choice (there's a full bar) while watching the sunset.

I'm quite familiar with what Kimo's was, and now I've become familiar with what it is.

My mom and I were in Lahaina, so we decided to go to Kimo's for lunch.  The service was awful.  First I asked for 2 waters, and she brought 1 -- we had 2 place settings, but my mom had gone to the bathroom. We started by asking questions about the fish.  When my mom said she didn't care for mahi mahi (not her taste, not my favorite fish either), the waitress got VERY defensive and said, ""Well, it's a very good fish, where have you had it before?""  My mom said, ""Here.  I just don't like it.""  She forgot to bring my mom's Diet Coke.  I ordered an ono sandwich without cole slaw, and we had a big discussion about it with the waitress telling me how it added crunch to the sandwich, and I still said, ""I don't want it.  No cole slaw.""  My sandwich came with a huge helping of cole slaw.  The fish was fine.  The Ceasar salad was what made me start eating lettuce, but now I can say it's not the best.  (I had another Ceasar salad that was way better at another restaurant on Front Street.)

The waitress spent a lot of time chatting with every other table except ours.  Which is fine, but we couldn't get the waitress' attention for refills of water and soda.  We had to ask other servers walking around.  We also couldn't get her attention for the check, so again we asked someone else.  She also didn't ask us if we wanted a hula pie.

We made reservations at 8:00pm and they were packed! Reservations are definitely recommended to avoid a 30-45 minute wait time. There is an upstairs and a downstairs to the restaurant; the downstairs has a large bar and it gets pretty loud so we sat upstairs in the dining room and it has a great view of the water. Service was nice, fast and attentive; it really elevated our dining experience.

We ordered the Herb Roasted Vegetable Dip appetizer to start and it was amazing! We all had pretty low expectations of it when we ordered it (it was the only Vegetarian appetizer) but were blown away by the dip (like a salsa in consistency) and the tasty bread. It was perfect!

I ordered the Miso Marinated Grilled Tofu which was the only Vegetarian entree. The tofu was grilled perfectly and had a good flavor, the sweet potato ravioli was handmade and was the best I've ever had, and the coconut milk sauce was perfection! So yummy.

My Husband ordered the Cioppino which he thought was good and packed with fish. It was a nice sized portion and came with a side of bread. My Stepdaughter had the Teriyaki Sirloin which she substituted chicken for and my Stepson enjoyed his fresh fish.

Lobster roll left something to be desired. Tasted like chicken salad on a roll.

The food, view and service for the price that you pay is all very worth it. Compared to most restaurants it's a value and not unrealistic. My only thing I don't love is how crowded it is when you walk and rather intense with all the people checking in, doesn't feel great but that's what a great place gets you.",Brad M.,"Mercer Island, WA",4.0 star rating

They are super busy, so I wouldn't call the service attentive, but we weren't ignored either.

We reserved a table and got a good (not great) view table upstairs - definitely book an upstairs table in advance.

In terms of food, our table was very happy overall.  The fish entries were very tasty and not too dry.  The pork ribs were very good.  Perhaps it was an off-night, but the prime rib was disappointing - it seemed overcooked.  Sides were all solid.

Fortunately, the other items we sampled -- an ahi sandwich, sashimi, and seafood chowder -- we're all delicious.  Very friendly and attentive service.  Superb setting.  You can spend lots more for lots less nearby (e.g., Mala's).  Kimo's is popular beyond belief because of its central location, ocean view and, of course, the Hula Pie! Hula Pie! HulaPie!

The shrimp cocktail was so good (large and chilled) we ordered another.  Iceberg salad was also good. Lobster tail was soft and tasty but one small tail for $45 was overpriced.   They already ran out of prime rib at 8:30....  Server was nice but forgot one of the drinks and messed up one of the sides.  They had a band who started playing Hawaiian music around 9.   They were so loud, we could not speak at the table anymore without yelling at the person next to you. It felt like front row seats at a rock concert. Overall, good food but avoid Friday night if you want a dinner experience.",Tak I.,"Danbury, CT",4.0 star rating

I ordered a burger that was advertised with a turkey patty, it was called a Beach bunny. But they let me change it to a beef patty and it became a Beef bunny. It had arugula, pesto, avocado, and vine ripened tomatoes. It was delicious!

My mom had a vegetable salad and added fish. She said it was absolutely amazing. The fish was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. 

We also had the sashimi appetizer which was perfectly cut and also super fresh. 

The chef special Hula pie of the day was pumpkin spice with a graham cracker crust. I still regret not ordering it!

So much that I got sick the next day. Again, the staff is so overwhelmed that asking to fix the order would do nothing. Would recommended for a drink with a view but nothing more.

He was rude. Did nothing to make us feel better that another table ordered what we wanted but we were denied and then tried to make excuses and tell us why he couldn't do ANYTHING for us. Not even a sorry. Perhaps the owners should have a better management team to lead these servers. I have been coming here for YEARS.

The hosts acknowledged his birthday, but our server did not. That was so disappointing. She was sweet, but I felt that bit off a piece off the customer service I was expecting. 

For pupus (appetizers) we enjoyed the ahi poke and chips. Home-made crispy thick chips whit a bit of salt. YUM! The dip consists of guac and fresh ahi pieces on top. We also got the ahi sashimi. Kind of disappointed as it was nothing special to me. 

For dinner I got the two lobster tails, which come with grilled veggies and rice pilaf. DELICIOUS. I would definitely recommended for you seafood lovers. We also enjoyed the prime rib. I prefer a sear on the steak, which the server had promised me. But it was only seated on one side facing down. VERY BUTTERY. So you'll either hate it or love it. It comes with a side of mash. 

Drinks. I would say the Island Sunset- a blended drink and spinoff of the lava flow but better! Can't really taste the alcohol tho.

7/2/2016,4.0 star rating,"My fiancé and I visited here for the first time and loved the view! We had the Lobster Slider and Calamari from their happy hour menu. The slider was delicious, the calamari was overrated.  

For our entrées, we had the Parmesan Crusted Opakapaka Fish and a 14oz Prime Rib. The fish was firm with a nice parmesan crust texture. The prime rib was cooked exactly the way we requested, was juicy, and came with creamy mashed potatoes which complimented the meat very well. The down side to both entrées is that the veggies each dish came with did not go well with either! It felt more like an afterthought and tasted a bit raw (like a squeegee). We were expecting something just as good as the star of the dish, but it unfortunately was not. 

We were so full that we had to walk off our dinner before coming back to eat the Hula Pie for dessert as suggested on Yelp. Ice cream is always good for dessert, but mix vanilla ice cream with their OREO CRUST...amazing!! My fiancé enjoyed the chocolate sauce a lot more than I did.

I had eaten fish all week long and decided on the filet.  The meat was very tender and was served with garlic mashed potatoes, asparagus and a roasted tomato topped with shaved parmesan cheese.  

We had a nice seat on the top deck with a nice view.  It was unseasonably warm with an extra does of humidity.  Many of the locals said this was one of the hottest summers they can remember.  The breeze was intermittent, but when it came, it was more than welcomed.

The atmosphere is that of a 19th century steakhouse, complete with shaker style chairs, wood paneling and paintings on the wall.  The menu is very interesting for the fish lover.  You get a variety of fish options that you can have prepared in a variety of ways.  

The service was great, and we had no complaints at all.  The fresh bread and carrot muffins were delicious.  I had the pulled pork wraps and a Caesar salad.  Both were excellent.  My husband had the mahimahi which was also excellent.

We were sat under a fan on the top floor several rows back from the view.  Though I was happy to be under the fan (why do no restaurants in Maui have a/c), I wished we'd had a better view.  The bathrooms were air conditioned, so I definitely popped in there more times than necessary during dinner!",Samantha L.,"Denver, CO",4.0 star rating
7/19/2015,5.0 star rating,"My bf and I made reservations here for our last night on Maui and it was wonderful.   We had a seating at 630pm so we could see the sunset.   We got a table on the upper deck next to the railing where we could see the water. 

The staff bring in the overhead awnings and roll up the sunshades when the sun starts to set and the sunset view was so beautiful that multiple people started coming around our table and started taking pictures.   

Aside from the lovely ambience,  we were taken in quickly after checking in since we had a table reserved and quickly shuffled upstairs.   Not all the tables have a sunset view so you need to ask for one when checking in.   You can also request waterside downstairs where the live music was playing.  

We were set on ordering prime rib,  so we didn't order any appetizers.   We got complimentary carrot muffins and bread with fresh butter.   It took a while to get our main course,  but it is a large and busy restaurant.   The views are a wonderful distraction while waiting.   The prime rib was very soft.   It came with sauteed vegetables and a starch.  Everything was delicious,  and I was sad to not have room for dessert as the hula pie on the next table looked tempting.  

There was no pressure from the staff to leave,  so we were able to enjoy ourselves.   In fact,  some guests who were there before us were still enjoying their wine when we left.  We could hear some of the live music from downstairs and people seemed happy.  

Prices are not bad for the experience and I was quite pleased.",Lynn U.,"Aiea, HI",4.0 star rating
4/2/2017,2.0 star rating,"Being born & raised on Maui we decided to eat at Kimo's for our anniversary since we hadn't eaten here in years. Extremely disappointed in the food quality. I remember being young & enjoying the food SO much! 

The ""macadamia nut"" calamari had no reason to be called ""macadamia nut"" calamari, there were no signs of macadamia nuts anywhere. The ahi poke stack was actually very, very good! 

I ordered the seared Ahi with Thai chili sauce & it was so salty I couldn't even eat it. Usually I wouldn't say anything, but it was so bad I sent it back. My boyfriend ordered the prime rib, med-rare temp, literally came out raw. He sent that back to be cooked longer as well. We ordered a side Tristan lobster tail which was covered in baked mayonnaise. Super unnecessary addition & ruined the lobster tail.

Our server Ryan, was helpful with all the food errors & sent us out a Hula Pie in honor of our anniversary which was super nice of him. As I'm eating it there was literally a significant size white paper that I bit into. At this point I'm like ""what the heck Kimo's!?"" I didn't say anything to Ryan about it since it was a free dessert. 

In our opinion Ryan did a good job, but the food was horrible. Never going back even though Kimo's holds nice childhood memories for us.",Crystal M.,"Paia, HI",4.0 star rating

When I was last at Kimo's I was very disappointed that their classic Cesar salad that was included with every entree was pathetically downsized, fast forward to tonight, Kimo's is now charging $6.00 for the pathetically small Caesar salad. I also ordered the calamari appetizer, the order was very small and over breaded; $13.50, way too much for what you get.

My dinner entree, coconut crusted marlin with Thai sauce was great, nice size portion and cooked to perfection.

Service: The staff were really friendly both over the phone while making my reservation and while greeting us and serving us. Someone celebrated their birthday there and the team sang happy birthday for them. 
Food portions were generous. I felt I could feed myself for 2 meals! For the price you pay the food is really great!
Selection: The selection on the menu was pretty good. I was quite pleasantly surprised by their Tofu entree which was was really well put together with multiple interesting components to wow the taste buds: Poi stuffed ravioli, Grilled tofu(marinated in a miso ginger sauce) and plated with some coconut cream and garnished with micro greens. The tofu tasted great with the sauce and the veggies and ravioli. I ordered a side of Maui grown veggies and it was so good and filling. I couldn't finish it.
My husband ordered their roasted Rosemary chicken. He really liked it and felt the same way about the quantity: it was a huge plate! We also ordered a virgin lava flow which tasted good as well.

Then moved upstairs for dinner. Scotty was a perfect  server. Got us our wines, drinks and made great recommendations. 

Food: kimo style was light refreshing, parmesan preparation also good, coconut crusted was good with a spicy kick, lobster topped had a good portion of lobster. My personal favorite was 14 oz prime rib. Best prime rib I've had and I've had some way pricier ones at steakhouses that pale in comparison. 

Dessert hula pie best of the many we have had on the island. Real tasty hot fudge and proper whipped cream. Tawny port and mudslide were good to end the night.",Jen L.,"Agoura Hills, CA",4.0 star rating
8/5/2017,5.0 star rating,"This review is coming from a former employee who now resides in Northern California.  The atmosphere at Kimo's represents delicious food, prime location, and the heart of hospitality.  The wine, cocktails, appetizers, salads, fish, prime rib, desserts, service, and cooks are all top notch.  From the moment you walk in for dinner you feel at home and treated to something special.  The GM Chris Almeroth is an absolute treasure who carries a fire and passion for customer service and quality products.  He is one of a couple captains steering this luxury vessel in a piece of paradise.  Jack Starr, what can I say other than this man is an absolute legend and champion of his craft.  His enthusiasm and ability to connect with people by making them feel welcome is truly heaven sent.  There are too many amazing people to mention, please forgive me those who I've left out. I had worked for Kimo's for about 8 years and I miss it tremendously.  Those who have worked there during my time got to see me spend a good part of life there, and bless their hearts for putting up with all my immaturity and shenanigans.

I'll start with my drink. It's called the Lava Flow. It's a Piña Colada with an eruption of strawberries. This I will get again. $10.

I ordered the Coconut Crusted Marlin. Tasteless, a tad dry and the sweet coconut sauce topping was overpowering. Good news is the small side of green beans and baby carrots were perfectly cooked. The Jasmine Rice that accompanied it was also delicious. $17.

The servers were pleasant. The hostess was friendly. Easy reservation made on Open Table. I'm giving this four stars even my dish was off just because I don't like sweet entrees. But Adam enjoyed his food. So I'm thinking wrong dish for me?

5/12/2015,4.0 star rating,"Are you new to Maui? Are you a repeat visitor and looking for a ""home base"" from which to jump-start your Hawaiian getaway? Look no further than Kimo's, which has established quite a reputation for being a go-to spot for visitors and I would assume locals who host visitors as well. You won't feel like you're stuck in a tourist trap here, rather you will feel welcomed by the egregious and friendly staff, you'll be tempted by their many fish and seafood options, and you will salivate over the many delicious-sounding cocktails on the extensive menu. Oh, and it's cliche, but you do need to try the Hula Pie, especially because you receive a coupon for a complimentary slice on your next visit to Kimo's or their sister restaurant, Duke's (see my review for Duke's for Hula Pie deets :) ).

As a first-time visitor to Maui, I was immediately entranced by charming Lahaina and its gorgeous waterfront. Feeling peckish, my husband and I decided we needed a square meal before diving into some shave ice at Ululani's.

Get a spot outside. Even though the dining area indoors is open to the outdoor patio, just get a table on the patio. You're worth it. This is vacation. 

For Pupus (appetizers), we started with the Koloa Pork RIbs. They were meaty yet tender, and didn't exude any of the fatty throwaway that's so common with ribs, so they were a tantalizing way to begin our first Maui meal. Entree-wise, I opted for the Fresh Fish Tacos, which truly were FRESH and also refreshingly served on corn tortillas, as they should be - fish was grilled, not over-salted or blackened, and served with just enough pico de gallo to add some bright flavor to the fish without taking away from the flavor of the fresh catch itself. My husband ordered the Fresh Island Fish, which is basically a roasted fillet of fresh-caught local fish, served up with a local salad and heirloom tomatoes. Again, simple and lets the fish speak for itself without unnecessary preparation or garnishes. Entrees are all priced around $18, so it's very reasonable, and portion sizes are plentiful.

Don't worry, if you're not into our friends who roam the sea, there are ample meat (and non-meat) options in terms of sandwiches and burgers. They also do a good job of labelling gluten-free items, and servers are knowledgeable and display integrity when it comes to honoring GF and dairy-free requests.

Parking is of course a pain, but just park in one of the pay lots and save yourself the stress of looking for something on-street if it's prime time for meal time.

OH! Cocktails - right! Don't forget to kickoff or wind down your vacation with a fruity, natural concoction. Their potent potables have the requisite garnishes - mine was unforgettable. I ordered the ""Backscratcher"" - and it was garnished with a wooden backscratcher, natch. The drink was boozy, fruity, and not too sweet.",Megan C.,"Herndon, VA",4.0 star rating

First of all, the view is spectacular. You walk in and see the ocean out through the back of the restaurant. If you're seated outside, you can enjoy the view while you're eating your meal, which is a huge plus. 

As for the food, it was also pretty good - I ordered the coconut crusted fish.  It was nice, although the fish was a bit dense and had almost the consistency of chicken rather than fish. Just have that in mind if you're planning to eat the fish so you can mentally prepare yourself.  It was still really good, though; the flavor of the coconut crust perfectly complemented the delicious pineapple salsa on top of the fish.",Kacey M.,"San Mateo, CA",4.0 star rating

I finally decided to start with a Ceaser salad which was refreshing. The salad had the right amount of dressing and I had a crouton in every bite!!!

Then I went with the Tristan Lobster Tails. It was roasted in a citrus type glaze over a bed of rice. It actually came with two lobster tails, which was generously sized. I gave my husband one and he gave me half of his sirloin, so we had a surf and turf type meal! The lobster was not chewy. It was nice and tender and so was the steak. The steak was very flavorful!

I only tried the carrot muffins and they were sooo good, especially slathered with some butter! They were perfectly moist, the sweetness of the muffins and the saltiness of the butter was a perfect combination! 

I ordered coconut crusted fish (I think it was machong), which came with rice and vegetables. The rice was incredibly flavorful. The Thai sauce had the perfect amount of heat. The vegetables were crisp, yet tender. I was afraid that the fish would be too oily, but it was not at all. It was perfect. One of the best dishes I've had while on my stay in Maui! It's up there with my meal in Mala Ocean Tavern (also left a review there)

I also ordered their virgin mango colada. It was good! But too sweet for my liking, wasn't able to finish it. 

The main reason why we came here - the hula pie! It was featured in one of food networks magazine so we knew we had to check it out! It was soo big but really good!

12/28/2015,5.0 star rating,"This was a wonderful meal and setting to end our Maui vacation. We made reservation for 4:45pm when the restaurant first opened. We got there a little bit before hand and had drinks off the aloha menu from the bar. I had the margarita that wasn't great. My boyfriend got a glass of deschutes. Good beer to have on tap for ipa drinkers. 

We were seated right at 4:45pm. We requested waterfront seating and we got it. (Most waterfront seats are two people). For drinks we had kimo's grog which was like a Moscow mule. It was delicious and easy to drink. We both had two. The bread provided was yummy fresh and warm. For starters we had the Kalua pork lettuce wraps. They were excellent! The plum sauce and raw onions were on point. For dinner I had the Mahimahi prepared ""kimo's style"" delicious! So fresh and buttery. Even the rice and veggies that came with were on point. My boyfriend got the opa (moonfish) that had some sort of lemon basil sauce. It was also delicious and so so fresh. 

We were too full for hula pie but it looked amazing and they gave us a coupon for free hula pie later! 

Our server was Scott. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. I would highly, highly recommend this place to anyone in Maui. Yum!",Antonia G. And Abel C.,"Newark, CA",4.0 star rating

2/26/2017,4.0 star rating,"We walked by Kimo's on our last trip so this time had to fit it in. Overall good restaurant and we rate it a four star overall:

Food: Salad - we each ordered the Iceberg and Blue Cheese and it was fantastic. Really good balance between the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. Main Course - my wife had their Mahi Mahi Kimo style and it was fabulous - fish was firm and it was perfectly prepared. I ordered the Seafood Pappardelle and it was perhaps average at best. The waitress spoke highly of it and I can't imagine why? Bland and minimal fish (only 4 or 5 shrimp). Again, absolutely no flavor! Disappointed.

Dessert - we shared their Hula Pie and it was fantastic!

Drinks - don't order the Mai Tai - lacked flavor, I always and only get Mai Tai's when in Hawaï and I would rate this the worst yet.

View - spectacular and especially last night we had a beautiful sunset!

Overall, have the fish and wait a bit longer for a table right on the edge so you have an unobstructed view. Clearly overpriced but it is Maui and to be expected.

True rating would be a 3.5 stars but since we can't do that....",Tony U.,"Agoura Hills, CA",4.0 star rating

I'm so happy that my boyfriend and I got here right before the sunset because the view was breathtaking! I really recommend the pork lettuce wrap appetizer... It was amazing!

My youngest sister did have food she didn't like but not only did the waitress come try to make it right she offered to remove it from the bill and replace it for free, although my sister opted not to accept she was extremely happy that they did care. Moments later the manager came out to ask if there was anything they could do to make her meal better, replace or and scenario where they could rectify the situation. She didn't want anything (she was pregnant) but she was SO happy at the way she was treated that we all decided to leave them a massive tip, well played Kimo's !!!

8/5/2016,4.0 star rating,"Great food, good view, and awesome service. For starters, we had the calamari and Fisherman's chowder and I loved them both! The chowder gives the infamous SF clam chowder a run for its money -- and I live in the Bay Area!  The calamari was nice and soft though the portion was disappointingly small. The Kimo style Ono was good - fish wasn't dry and the sauce was tasty. The hubby got the prime rib and that was fantastic! I couldn't stop raving about it. And of course the hula pie was just perfect.

My husband enjoyed his Lemonade cocktail however his beer tasted old. The best thing we ate was  the Hula Pie it's a must. We ate the whole thing. Besides the food the view and service is amazing.

Waitress wasn't the friendliest, but she wasn't rude or anything either. Wedge Salad and pulled pork sandwich were awesome.

We started off with a a Kalua pig in lettuce appetizer.  Perfect flavor and very tasty.  The other appetizer that we highly recommend is their ahi poki stack.  Fresh ahi that was prepared right.  

For dinner we had the mahi mahi and the prime rib.  The mahi mahi was perfectly cooked and was of the best dishes we had all week.  

Dessert we had the mud pie. It was the perfect way to end the meal.

The service was EXTREMELY slow. We had empty drinks longer that we had drinks...once we actually finally got drinks, that is. 
My burger was dry and boring. I didn't finish it. The patio was loud with screaming kids. We did get sat on the edge, so at least we had a good view of the ocean (thus the one star rating).

Finished it fast. Totally coming back tomorrow. Service is nice and the view is spectacular. Price is affordable and the view makes you feel like you're in heaven. It can be noisy but that's just the tourist attraction type of restaurant so it's completely fine. The bartender was funny and humorous.

6/21/2017,3.0 star rating,"My husband and I were very excited to try Kimo's after checking out the Yelp page and hearing a hotel staff member recommend it. However, we were definitely underwhelmed by the experience. The service was not great for us, as our waitress seemed to have a lot of other things on her mind. It took a very long time for us to receive the bread basket after ordering. We ordered the lobster topped mahi mahi and the shrimp papardelle. The mahi mahi was quite good at first, but then the fish seemed to lose flavor towards the end. The side of rice with the mahi mahi was flavorful and good though. The noodles in the shrimp papardelle were not very flavorful, and the dish only came with four shrimp, which was underwhelming. The kale was very good though, surprisingly good for kale. One big perk of the restaurant seemed to be the ocean side view, but we were seated at a table with no view of the ocean. Overall we think the quality of our experience does not correlate with the price.",Marilyn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating

We were out photographing all day and had to wait a couple of hours for sunset to get a few more pictures so were looking for a place to grab a drink and some pupus.  We just randomly picked Kimo's because it was along the Lahaina waterfront and was expecting a touristy place with just so-so food.  What we got was some ice-cold happy hour drinks and some pretty tasty food.

There were 3 of us and we had a mix of some margaritas on the rocks and some beer.  All drinks came quickly and were refreshingly cold.  For pupus we had some potato skins, smoked fish bruschetta, and some teri chicken sticks with peanut sauce.  All of the food was really good.  The cold drinks and the good food really hit the spot after a long day of shooting.  That view of the water couldn't be beat as well.

We specifically requested a table by the water and mentioned it was our honeymoon and we were stuck at a very small table upstairs that fits one comfortably. The only view was of the umbrellas on the first floor. We asked to move tables downstairs and had to switch again to a third table in order to get a server to visit the table.  

Once we finally got to a table with a good server our experience drastically improved. We started with the pork lettuce wraps which were awesome. My husband ordered the 32 oz bone in prime rib. It was probably closer to 50 oz and he loves it. I ordered an add on lobster tail with a side baked potato. Both were delicious. They had a 2 lobster tail entree but 10 oz of lobster tail is too much for me. Overall once we were greeted by a server we had a great time at Kimos.

Timothy took care of us with a glass of Pinot Grigio and a Kimo Grog cocktail (awesome for ginger lovers!) and we ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer which was excellent. Marc had the Kimo style mahi mahi which was a baked fish dish: very moist and tasty. I had the Parmesan crusted ono which was served with capers and a delicious sauce: absolutely loved it and finished every bite. No room for dessert, all up dinner was $95 + tip which we felt was worth it based on the quality and tastiness of the meal. An evening highlight was the fascinating conversation with an Alaskan guy standing beside us regaling us with stories of his life and the tv show he was in town to film, a real character and total random meeting.

We always order fresh fish while on the island and Kimo's has a nice variety of choices and preparations.  We have ordered the grilled fish for the kids and that is aways a big hit.  The coconut crusted fish has great flavor although my fish was a bit overcooked on our last visit.  The prime rib was also very good if you are wanting something other than seafood.

I remember I was mesmerized by the crabs that crawled up and along the rock wall beneath the restaurant. I was also pretty stoked on the bread basket. Fast forward 21 years and I recently returned from a visit with my husband, still mesmerized by crabs and a fabulous bread basket but this time also highly impressed with the impeccable service (our goof meant we missed our reservation and came on a night when we didn't have one - they still honored our reservation and seated us immediately, despite a busy restaurant) and delectable food (ono bruschetta, coconut crusted marlin, prime rib, a huge slice of Hula Pie that never changes and I hope never will).

12/17/2015,4.0 star rating,"We had dinner at Kimo's on our last night in Maui. It was a delicious treat. Parking in Front St proved problematic during our visit but we lucked out with street parking right in front (good way to start dinner)

We arrived a little earlier than our 8 pm reservation (highly recommend as place was packed) and we asked for a table close to water. We were told that it might take a little longer which was not a problem. We went to the bar and my Dad had a piña colada (which was perfection), I had the mango colada which was way too sweet. Should have stuck to the regular piña colada instead. 

Ten minutes after 8 PM we were seated in a lovely table upstairs facing the water. Our waiter was friendly and present throughout service. 

I ordered a Mai tai which was very well done (not too sweet, not too boozy) followed by a wedge salad which was very tasty. 

My father had the cioppino which tasted good but overpriced for the amount. It was not a soup like consistency but he says tasted very good. 

I had one of six fish of the day. Hawaiian Opa done in a Parmesan crust lemon caper beurr blanc sauce. (The waiter recommended it) which tasted fine...I wasn't that impressed but was still good. 

The highlight of the meal was the dessert. Even though we were full we shared a piece of the Hula pie. A beautiful combination of macadamia ice cream, ganache, fudge, whipped cream and macadamia nuts made the meal for us. 

Prices are not cheap but food and ambience made it a worthwhile dining experience.",Martin R.,"Redwood City, CA",4.0 star rating

4/28/2016,4.0 star rating,"Here's my review of our 1st visit to Kimo's. I'll rate in order that we received our food. 
1. Coconut Shrimp - 5 stars, It was so good I almost divorced my wife because she tried to take one my shrimps.
2. Koloa Pork Ribs - 5 stars, My wife ordered this because she's allergic to fish. When she got the plate I didn't think she would be able to finish all of it. I was wrong. Those were some of the best ribs I've ever tasted. Yes, that I tasted. Even though it was her order I couldn't help but get a piece. The meat was falling off the bone and that plum sauce was great. 
3. Citrus Herb Grilled Fish - 4 1/2 Stars, I only give it that because I thought the fish was little overcooked for my liking. Some people might like it that way. But other than that, my plate was cleaned within 5 minutes. The marinade on that fish is what kept it above 4 stars. I felt liked ordering another plate it was so good. 
4. Last but not least, Hula Pie - 4 Stars. Not the best dessert I've ever had, But it was still good. 5 star desserts aren't easy to come by, so I'm hesitant to give that to anybody. 

We really enjoyed our food and service at Kimo's. I would recommend it to anybody visiting maui. We went for dinner and our waiter was Ina. Very good service, even though she did talk a lil fast...lol.",Kenneth D.,"Pearl City, HI",4.0 star rating

6/26/2016,5.0 star rating,"My fiance and I ate here on our recent trip to Maui.  I was looking for a nice, oceanfront restaurant in the hopes of capturing an iconic Hawaiian sunset and this place was perfect!

We were seated in the upstairs dining room where all of the tables had good views of the ocean.  We were still full from lunch and torn between ordering the ""famous"" prime rib or catch of the day.  I decided to order light and got the Fisherman's Chowder and Sweet Potato Brussels Sprout Hash.  The chowder was delicious and packed generously with fish, clams (I think?) and potatoes.  The hash was a bit dry and just OK.  My fiance ordered the Molokini Cut Prime Rib (14 oz.) and it was DELICIOUS!  Seriously, the best prime rib I've ever had and tender enough to cut with a butter knife. 

They also have a great ""Aloha Hour (Happy Hour)"" from 3-5PM that we didn't get to in time, but the appetizers and drink specials look fantastic.  Make sure to save room for the Hula Pie.  It's a HUGE slice of ice cream with Oreo Cookie crust (enough for 4 people).

I've been here twice.  Once for my 5 year anniversary with my husband and then most recently for my sister-in-laws wedding welcome dinner.  Great experiences both on an intimate and group experience.  

With my husband we sat downstairs near the patio and live music.  Great place to catch the views, enjoy some strong drinks and eat well.  

For the group dinner, we ate on the second floor with still a great view.  We were offered a smaller selection of meal options okayed by the bride and groom and enjoyed our time upstairs.  Only downside upstairs is that it was hot in the back... only cool spots away from the patio was if you were right under a ceiling fan.

Overrated, lots of reviews but and maybe people feel happy and give higher reviews while on vacation...but really this place would not make it if it wasn't located right by the water.  Unfortunately we didn't even have a table that faced the water...

I don't want to lose sight of my review!  
Salty, salty fish, salty mashed potatoes, salty veggies! It's supposed to be seasoned, not salted to death.  If I was looking to make jerky, I could do it at home.  My wife had the prime rib, cooked to perfection medium rare, but as you may have guessed it, salty!  I sent my fish dish back not once, twice!  UNDERCOOKED Mahi and OVERSALTED plates could not be saved!  
Sure the manager came over twice and tried his best to make things better. Before the main dishes, we had (wilted) Ceaser salad, didn't want to try the dessert...
I'm giving it 2 stars, right by the water and service was great!

This place had its time and it's definitely past, too bad!

10/19/2016,3.0 star rating,"The staff was pleasant. The ambiance was pleasant. The place had a typical Hawaiian theme, surrounded by tiki torches and waiters in Hawaiian shirts. It's gimmicky. 

The food was cooked well considering the number of plates that go through their kitchen. In fact our order came out instantly which led me to believe that things are prepped and reheated for maximum efficiency. The dishes were average in preparation while the cost was high. Definitely disproportionate and there to capitalize on tourists. 

I had Mahi mahi topped with lobster, paired with steamed carrots and green beans.. The fish was cooked properly but lacked flavor. Without the sauce and topping , it was bland and the veggies were reminiscent of airline food. The beet salad also flavorless. The wedge salad that we asked to have lightly dressed was drowning. The hula pie which everyone raved about was merely a giant wedge of vanilla macadamia nut ice cream under a layer of chocolate. The pina colada had so little vodka , it tasted like a smoothie. 

They turn their tables frequently and it shows. While their prices are a smidge below Lahaina Grill, it might be worth springing for the less commercial , less herd-like restaurant",Betty V.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

Amber was our server and she was great. But not only do you have your main server, there are roaming servers who are so attentive to make sure you always have what you need. 

We ordered the coconut shrimp to start and it was delicious! They were so fresh and cooked perfectly. They also brought out fresh bread to start, a warm roll and a carrot cake muffin that was great. I ordered the citrus herb grilled fish which for the day was a white fish similar to swordfish. My husband ordered the lobster topped opa. We were looking for fresh seafood and this is exactly what we got. For drinks the lava one was fruity and delicious but I wouldn't recommend the pineapple mojito, it was disappointing.

The inside is all wood and of cousre opens up to the outside so you can get the breeze from the water.

My wife's fish was over cooked.

Due to the rain I tried to eat quick and ended up eating a portion of the uncooked steak. I didn't feel well afterwards. Normally, I would have said something at the outset,  but everyone was getting wet and I wanted to get them home. The waitress did take it off our bill.

The waves ended up almost getting my camera wet before anyone warned me of it possibly happening. Also a few crabs showed up around our table so we switched tables. With the switch of the waitresses they weren't really patient with our food order and we felt they weren't genuinely happy with us being there. They also kept messing up why we were in Maui and out to dinner to celebrate. My husband was asked if it was our anniversary upon sitting down and he said no honeymoon. Then the waitress asked if we were there for a birthday and we said no honeymoon. Then when she brought the check she said ""happy anniversary!""....strike 3.

The roasted beet salad is  delicious. They are local beets mixed with arugula which gives it such a great tangy zing. The Surfing Goat (local) cheese balances it and the macademia nuts provide the perfect crunch. Tossed with a champagne, basil  vinaigrette makes it a true  winner!

They sat us down quickly which was great since we were all starving. It took awhile before someone actually came over to take our drink order. We all ordered alcoholic drinks. One of my friends renewed her ID the week we left for Maui. They denied giving her a drink because the manager said she should have gotten it by now. Now I dont know how the manager could possibly know that she should have gotten it by now when it had only been a few days ago. But whatever we just let it go. The food took awhile before it got to our table and the presentation of the food was not the great. It kind of looked like left overs on a plate. My boyfriend ordered ""da hawaiian plate,"" which is not even a little close to a real hawaiian plate. I mean teriyaki chicken and ribs on a hawaiian plate? And it was $16 for two little pieces of chicekn and 4 ribs? Yeah not worth it at all. Throughout our whole time there, our waitress came around about twice besides taking our order. But she managed to check on other tables? Maybe it was the color of our skin, because majority of the customers were predominantly white.

Started off with some seared ahi, coconut shrimp and ribs. You're always going to get a good meal here, key word, good. If your looking for good food and a great location, go no further, this is it. Lunch menu and dinner menu is different so keep that in mind. For my entree, I went with my gut and proceeded the fresh fish of the day.

4/24/2014,5.0 star rating,"While working on Maui yesterday, I found myself in the Lahaina area. My day went pretty smoothly, as everything fell into place.......don't you just love days like that????

Well anyways, it was time to ""grab a grub, grub!"", and Kimo's was the place of choice yesterday.

What can I say about this place???? Well, TOURIST place for sure, but Kimo's has been around for ages, so how can you go wrong with that? 

Upon getting seated right away, the friendly waitress took my order quickly. I wanted something light that day, so I ended up ordering the ""Seared Ahi Salad"" and an Ice Tea (no booze, some people have to work ya know! Lol!).

What can I say about the grub........the Ahi was all so fresh! The salad was really interesting........it had shredded greens, crisp local vegetables, roasted peanuts, & I think soy beans, with a ginger-rice wine vinaigrette dressing. Tasted pretty good, and it hit me in the right spot, as it was not too heavy.

Don't want to eat too much when I'm not well rested, otherwise I gonna get a Kanak Attack!
In fact when I was a young boy, I once almost drove into a ditch on the Big Island in the Pahoa area because of the Kanak Attach! Lol!!! Driving by braille is no fun my friends!

But the highlight of this meal was the all so beautiful scenery!!!! This restaurant is ocean front, so the view  is spectacular!

Overall, I'd give my meal a solid ""4"", but the fast & friendly service, with the spectacular view.........I had to bump it up a notch to a ""5""! If you're ever in the Lahaina area........check 'em out gang!!!",Fran C.,"Honolulu, HI",4.0 star rating
1/16/2016,3.0 star rating,"We heard such amazing things about Kimo's and were really disappointed when we left. 
The service was good but the food is really mediocre. 
We started with the bleu cheese and bacon Wedge. They split it on two plates for us which was awesome but it was just an overdressed head of lettuce. And the bacon. I was afraid I was going to chip my teeth. We couldn't bite through it. It was like biting on a rock. 
My boyfriend had the teriyaki sirloin; which wasn't bad but the vegetables were borderline undercooked and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were sitting around waiting to be put on a plate. I had the Panko and Parmesan crusted Ono. It was pretty chewy and I think there was too much breading. My potatoes tasted just like by boyfriends and so did my vegetables. We went for ginger ale and it didn't taste anything like ginger ale. It was really sweet and bland.

5/1/2015,5.0 star rating,"Absolutely hands down the best meal I've had on the island. 

My husband and I are on our honeymoon and came here off of a handful of recommendations from people who frequent Maui and who used to live here. We were seated up on the 2nd floor deck with the most gorgeous view of the sunset. We we were so happy we made a reservation because these seats fill up quickly. Our waitress Amy was such a delight. Extremely knowledgeable not only of each dish and how it's prepared, but more importantly WHY each ingredient was used. It was insightful and enjoyable listening to her up sale when I usually nod off 2 seconds into such recited spiels. 

We started off with the Smoked Fish bruschetta. The crostini was the perfect blend of crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The horseradish cream, capers and red pepper drizzles were so unique. A must try! 

My husband ordered the Teriyaki Sirloin ($26.95) and opted for the Lobster tail addition ($17) making it a quintessential surf and turf. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables (green beans and carrots). He's very picky with meat and had nothing but raving reviews. I chose the chef recommended fish with a Coconut crusted preparation ($28.95). This was a pleasant surprise as I am not a huge fan of coconut. The fish was lightly breaded with Panko and coconut flakes topped with a fresh pineapple salsa and a Thai peanut dipping sauce, served on a bed of basmati rice with steamed veggies. I could have taken a bath in that sauce, it was that good. 

The atmosphere, food and service are more than deserving of five stars in our book. So much so that we made a reservation on our way out for the last night of our trip!!

The meat is tender and seasoning amazing!
We also ordered the chicken dish which was also delicious and plenty.

I had filet mingon and lobster and my husband had the coconut crusted. All was good but I wish I'd just had the lobster. Steak was average but well cooked.

Our party of 6 showed up promptly and I checked in with the hostess. She let us to the upstairs area where we waited a few minutes until the table was ready. We had one of the best tables over looking the water. It was jaw dropping beautiful an hour before sunset. 

Our waitresses (one for food and the other was taking care of the drinks) introduced themselves, let us know the specials and took our orders. I ordered the rosemary roasted chicken with macadamia nut stuffing ($24) and a Cosmo. 

The table was given white bread rolls and carrot muffins. The rolls weren't anything special but the muffins were warm, sweet and light. I could have taken a couple to have for breakfast the next day. The rosemary chicken was a huge portion, half a chicken cooked perfectly. The stuffing was good but a bit on the salty side. It also came with fresh veggies that were cooked and had a nice crunch and seasoning. Everyone was too stuffed for dessert. The pies did look amazing. 

Service was attentive. Prices are great for the portion and quality given. The restaurant is very large with a full bar downstairs. I recommend reservations since it is popular.",Amber S.,Bay Area,4.0 star rating
6/5/2015,4.0 star rating,"If you are roaming Front Street and looking for a good lunch/dinner restaurant, Kimo's is a great choice. It offers a breathtaking view with lots of outdoor seating on the patio. Plentiful surf & turf options. 

To get started, they'll serve you a bread basket with mini carrot muffins and crunchy, soft bread rolls. The whipped butter served on the side is absolutely perfect paired with both. 
We got the steamed clams as a starter and the marinated tofu and sirloin steak with lobster tail and coconut shrimp as add-ons ($17 for the lobster, $10 for the shrimp), as well as a side of vegetable hash. Overall, the food was well-cooked and delicious; portions were just enough.
Don't forget to snag a coupon online for a free Hula Pie (which is basically your classic Mud Pie). Conquer it with the sporks they give you. Honestly, it was just ""meh"" for me; it was really just oo much - but it came at no additional cost, so I won't complain.

4/26/2015,3.0 star rating,"Still an incredible view with reasonably friendly service but believe the food quality is not worthy of the hefty dinner prices.

Baked Kimo's Style Mahi Mahi (4 stars, $29.95) - roasted with a garlic, lemon and sweet basil glaze - surprisingly delicious and moist for a baked fish dish. I'd do this again.  

Seafood Cioppino (2.5 stars, $27.95) - SPICY as heck. So spicy that it took away any enjoyment of the fresh seafood in the dish. Now the waitress did warn me that it was spicy (and I can handle spicy), but this dish was way overly spicy.

7/20/2017,1.0 star rating,"I haven't sat down to dinner yet - and the food may be good - but this restaurant is guilty of one of my biggest pet peeves --- we made a reservation for a table near the water and arrived on time only to be told in a rather indifferent tone that we would have to wait beyond our reservation to get a table. I asked how long and got a clipped ""I don't know."" It's now been 45 minutes. Most good restaurants will cruise by the tables and give you some sense of whether people have just ordered or may be about to leave. And no apology. I don't mind Waiting 10 or 15 minutes and I know that sometimes things get out of their control. But having to wait more than a half hour - without any effort to give us an update - tells me the restaurant cares little about customer service.  There are a lot of great and equally busy restaurants in Lahaina so far this week we've eaten in several of them - and we were treated far better and the food was great. I'll stick to those in the future.

8/28/2015,4.0 star rating,"Kimo's is an institution.

At least for us.  Ever since my family has come to Maui, we always eat at Kimo's at some point during our stay.

Located in Lahaina, Kimo's is one of a few restos here that are worth seeking out (others being simple tourists traps capitalizing on a killer location).  The food is always fresh-tasting and well-prepared and the views are killer.  

On our 10 year anniv visit, came here with M&D to have lunch.

I ordered a Bloody Mary which was, thankfully, spicy and viscous. Still not better than the Grey Horse back home but a decent libation nonetheless.

I had the  Sashimi app which was shiny, almost translucent, super fresh, refreshing and tasty.  I dunno if it was the BEST sashimi I ever had but it was highly enjoyable.  So much so that I was tempted to order another.  I also had a Koloa Pork ribs app.  Sticky, sweet, the meat pulled easily off the bone.  Again, not sure if this was the BEST ever, but it was pretty damned enjoyable.

Wife ordered the Ahi Poke Avocado Tower which she did not share (looks like there won't be an 11th anniv celebration).  But it looked good and she, at least, let me take a picture of it.  Mom had fish tacos and could only eat 1 (WHAT? I cannot be birthed from your loins!) so the other I had seemed quite tasty but, TBH, there are other fish taco options that are probably on par.  Dad had the fish sandwich (you daredevil, you!).

We finished by sharing the Hula Pie.  Yeah.  All FOUR of us.  Truthfully, it's probably good for two to share but the thing is as big as Giada De Laurentiis' baby's head (if she had a baby) and well worth getting.  In fact, if you're cruising around Lahaina town, stop in for JUST the Hula Pie.  

It's life changing.

Overall, D.F.L. as usual.

We walked in around 1pm on a week day and they were able to take us right away! We even got an amazing table right next to the ocean! I loved that all the tables outside had their own shade so we weren't burning under the sun! Our table was actually really dirty when we were seated and i was shocked because I had to mention to our server twice that we needed it wiped down, I got chocolate on my hand ! 

Anyways, they do have a few different options on their lunch menu and I was extremely happy with my choice. I decided on the beet and spinach grilled shrimp salad. IT WAS AMAZING. I ate every last bite! The golden and red beets went well with the spinach and goat cheese and added Mac nuts for some crunch! The shrimp were also grilled to perfection! My family all enjoyed their plates as well! Of course we ordered the famous ""Hula Pie"" and let me tell you- it did not disappoint!

We have a family tradition to hit this spot at least once in any visit to paradise on earth - back at least 14 times to Maui since 1996. Today we met another couple for the first time for lunch at 1 PM, and the best things about our visit  -  no waiting for our table (took two minutes to set up table for 6) and the great view of the ocean with Lanai in the background. Had the fish tacos, my wife a fish sandwich (both were $18) - Ono and our granddaughter had Ahi Poke & Avocado Stack for $17.50 - this was an appetizer.

Food was good - not great, but good.  We got the coconut shrimp which were good, but there weren't too many for the price.

On the way over (we flew Hawaiian Airlines) there was an ad on the back of one of the airline magazines you can take a picture of and get a free Hula pie - so we did and it was delicious.  Like really delicious.  And free.

We would have preferred near the balcony but since we called in late it's understandable they couldn't accommodate our request. 
Our server was very detailed in explaining the specials of the day. I opted for the baked Kimo's Style Opakapaka coz I haven't tried that fish yet and i should say it was delicious. It was worth it's price ($35). My husband also enjoyed his Lobster topped Opah.

I was not impressed with the food, disappointed in the overall sense of ""hurry"" we felt throughout the dining experience. Loud and overpriced; Last night we ate at Paia Fishmarket near banyan tree, way better and half the price and casual.
SERVICE at Kimos:  Our waitress Neli was horrible. Speaking of Aloha spirit! She had the worse attitude and didn't check up on the table to see if we needed anything. She was pretty much avoiding the table at all cost. 
After I asked for another soda, and nicely, i might add because i have worked for years in food service and know not to be rude to fellow servers; it took over 30 minutes to get another soda. She also messed up an order and tried to blame the person who brought the food out in front of us. Later when I used bathroom I noticed her near the bar texting on her smartphone.

Yummy!
This place has the best Hula Pie on the island. No need to make reservations. If there is room on the patio, you can seat yourself if you are just stopping in for dessert. 
It is a great place to sit and enjoy a tasty treat, watch the ocean, and visit.
Traditionally Hula Pie is made with an Oreo Cookie Crust, macadamia nut ice cream and topped with hot fudge and macadamia nuts. 
However, this trendy place has a chef special where the chef puts a twist on the classic dessert.
This time the chef special was Dolce De Leche Hula Pie. The crust was graham cracker crust, dolce de leche ice cream and topped with caramel!  Yum!
The portion size is huge! You could easily share it with a friend or a special someone.
This place is a must stop on any trip to Maui!

After having Hula Pie for a snack, we decided to return for dinner. We had several different cocktails made by George, the bartender. The were all tasty and delicious. He was friendly and made our experience at the bar a memorable one.
For dinner, we tried a variety of fish dishes, ribs, and the prime rib. They all were tasty and were cooked to perfection.

I believe the bartender said the meat was ground on the premises.  I gave it the extra star because of the bar service.  I didn't even order a drink and they still kept refilling my water glass, even after I had paid.  Most bartenders are done with you once you pay the tab, or if they realize that you are not going to buy any alcohol, they move on, but George and the other bartender provided excellent service.  

And get the pie, it's amazing.

Our server, (also named Kimo, whaaat?!) was very chill and friendly and gave us great recommendations. He listed off all the five fishes they were serving and not only were we impressed about how much information these servers have to remember, but he delivered it simply like he was telling us information, rather than rattling off a laundry list like we've experienced in most restaurants when we're told of the specials.

Calamari- Thicker slices than I'm used to and it was delicious.
Clam Chowder- YUM. Has a thinner consistency than most chowders I've had before but it totally worked. Great flavor.
Rosemary Chicken- Excellent flavor in this dish, and the polenta was fantastic.

I told Kimo in private it was our anniversary and he surprised us with a MASSIVE slice of hula pie, ""on Kimo"". (Wait, you Kimo or restaurant Kimo?) Ohmygod so good.

Kimo's is worth a visit if you are in Lahaina. The restaurant is more formal than most in the area but succeeds in staying casual enough to welcome diners dressed for shopping and/or beach activities. The bar area and the dining area have different menus and the dining area usually requires a wait so they recommend that you make a reservation. 

The restaurant itself is very nice. Ocean views are standard with almost all tables. The dining area is upstairs giving diners the feeling of eating on an ocean liner (sans 15 naut headwinds). I really enjoyed the ambiance. The waitstaff is knowledgable and professional. Service is slow compared to a mainland restaurant, but not to a fault. The food was very good. We opted for fresh fish dishes. Our waiter explained the preparation options without pushing anything on us. The food was delicious but not revolutionary. Attention to flavor was paid to main courses and side items alike. I was not disappointed with anything on the plate but I was not blown away by the flavor either. All in all I'd say this is a pretty darn good way to go if you're looking for good fresh seafood.

1/8/2015,3.0 star rating,"The bf and i were walking around the area not too sure of what we wanted to eat for lunch until we passed by Kimo's a few time. So we decided to yelp the place and got some decent reviews so we said, ""why not!?"" It was a super hot day and the view of the beautiful ocean was right there with a good breeze under the umbrella's for shade.

As we always do when we were in vacation, we tend to share dishes so we can eat more other good stuff later on! We ordered the macadamia crusted calamari, turkey and avocado on focaccia and the infamous hula pie.

The calamari was just ok. Doesn't have enough of that crunch that we like when we order calamari. Since the waitress knew that we were sharing the sandwich, she had them split the meal into 2 dishes. Which was a plus because it's not often that they do that in restaurants. The sandwich was delicious as expected because duh! what can go wrong with turkey, avocado, pesto and tomato!? Nothing! that's what!

And now for the infamous hula pie that everyone was raving about. Personally i thought it was okay. And i thought the ice cream flavor was vanilla. Apparently it's macadamia nut flavor when the waitress was being asked by a group of patrons next to us asking what it was. It has a oreo cookie crust with lots and lots of fudge. It wasn't the best thing i ever had but i also couldn't stop eating it.

Would i come back? Ehh..maybe...maybe not. We'll see. It is a bit pricey. But we expected it from this touristy area.",Victoria H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0 star rating

After dark you can listen to the waves breaking along the boardwalk and the sounds of the Hawaiian guys playing at he bar (they're really good). 

The food is so-so. Over prices tourist food. It's not bad by any means but it's just highly rated for location. 

The coconut shrimp are pretty good but you only get a few of the little guys. Fish tacos were bland but the quality of the ingredients was good. Good locals beers on tap.

11/25/2013,4.0 star rating,"Totally worth the touristy hype.  We sat upstairs on the outtermost edge where we had an unobstructed view of the water and our first Maui sunset.  

A brief drizzle had a magic electronic awning extend over us.  Service was pretty much as good as it gets.  My man is allergic to seafood and nuts (including macadamia) and it is rare that we receive such great service in this regard.  The server double checked everything.  When servers changed, the new server came by and confirmed that he knew about the allergies and would make sure my man was ok.  Then the manager came over to personally guarantee that he was overseeing my man's meal, and after everything came, they checked up on it twice!  I was very impressed.  At the end of our meal, the manager came by again to confirm that everything was to our liking and that we had no allergy issues.  Great Job Kimos!

The drinks were oh so sweet and tasty.  The fish was oh so fresh and well prepared.  I had Monchong.  I had never heard of this fish and thus HAD to try it.  Very meaty and tasty.  Firm yet moist and not fishy at all.  LOVED it.  My man had a wonderfully cooked steak dish.  The food was prepared beautifully and was very tasty.  The presentation of the food was homey  and unpretentious.  I think this bothers some people who are not used to paying the prices without having some artistic sculpture on their plates.  But hey, tourist spots usually are a little pricey anyway, what do they call it....oh ""Paradise Tax"" heehee.

That truly says something about the restaurant and the whole TS Group (that owns Kimo's among other restaurants)!

I ordered the Prime Rib both times as it is fantastic.  I am a dedicated red meat eater and Kimo's prepares their Prime Rib as well as I've ever had.  If you go, and you like Prime Rib, it is a must get.  I got the smaller portion (if you can call 14 ounces small) and could not finish the vegetables and mashed potatoes that came with it!  Serving size is not an issue here.

The Hula Pie is legendary and well worth all the hype.  I'm not much of a dessert eater when I'm out, but the Hula Pie is just too good to pass up.  I like it so much I want to buy one of the special plates it is served on!!

Service was exemplary and the view is unbeatable.  We were seating about 30 minutes before sunset and were treated to a view unlike any other.  It was something out of a painting.  The way Kimo's is set up, just about every seat has a breath taking view of sunsets.

10/14/2015,1.0 star rating,"I used to swear by this place as the best hamburger on Maui. I've been going there since 1980.  No more.

Success has truly gone to their heads, or maybe now they are owned by a large corporation.

I will admit the atmosphere is beautiful, and you have great ocean views. That's about where it ends.

The dinner menu is as high priced as any place you'll find on the Las Vegas Strip, or in Manhattan, New York City. The quality is truly equal to any other overpriced resort area.

The Great American Burger is now $15.00. It is thick, but all of us agreed it wasn't that good. In fact it was a unanimous decision that the Double Double at In 'n Out, is fresher and better tasting. 

Everyone from the hostess that greets you to the servers and bussers, acts polite, but it's hard to look past their hardened attitude, acquired from snobby resort vacationers that frequent the place.

Years ago, I bought a Tank Top, because of the catchy logo. When I hit the T Shirt Bar (as they call it), I was told a T shirt in my XL size was $51.00. Sorry, I'm not a Kardashian.

Lahaina itself is a high rent, tourist town crammed with an abundance of art galleries and junk jewelry stores. Most of the places are either brands you find in anytown (Forrest Gump Shrimp; Hard Rock Cafe; Joe's Crab Shack), and thus you are getting Corporate food quality at an inflated price.

Suggest you journey to Paia, and try the local eateries there. Better tasting food, and far better value.",Jack R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating

We ordered the prime rib and Mac Nut Mahi Mahi.  The bread they gave us was fresh and everyone loved it.  That's the sign of a good meal to come!  We ordered Lava Flows to drink, and they even had virgin lava flows for 2.5 year old daughter.  Yes, she can join her Mommy and Daddy!  The prime rib was good.  I recommend that if 2 people are going to order it, to order the biggest size and share it.

We ordered the calamari and coconut shrimp as appetizers and they were great, my only negative comment about them is that they were both extremely hot but that's not really a complaint! 

Our waiter went through the fish of the day and was very knowledgeable about how they were prepared. I  mentioned I was looking for something not too fishy and he made some suggestions. Ultimately we ended up ordering the ""Kimo"" style Mahi Mahi and the Coconut crusted Marlin and oh em gee! Both of these dishes were AMAZING! The Mahi Mahi was light and flaky and the Marlin was denser (as he explained it would be). The sauce, crust and salsa for the Marlin was excellent, it complimented the fish without overpowering it. The Mahi Mahi was equally as delicious and oh so flaky! Overall a great experience and would definitely come again!

Service was seriously good.  Pam came to check on us no less than 10 times over the course of an hour and a half; refilling waters, bringing extra plates, going the extra mile.

Ended the evening with a birthday hula pie for the kiddo.  She *REALLY* enjoyed the chocolate and chewy nuts in the ice cream.  Thing was enormous though, I suggest folks share - as we had one for the 4 of us and that was plenty.

9/17/2014,5.0 star rating,"Kimo's!!!

Personally, I don't feel like the 5 stars is exactly justified, but my group enjoyed it so much it was contagious I guess.

In our week long trip to Maui, this was the only place we went to twice (aside from one chain restaurant, which will go nameless).  We actually made a point of coming back here on our last full day in Maui.

Definitely go for lunch, as the prices, while still high, are relatively reasonable for the island.  The burgers were tasty as well as the Sloppy Jack (like a Sloppy Joe, but named Jack), and I couldn't help but notice being seated right at the water (as in we literally got a spattering from a few waves during lunch), that if this restaurant were to exist in California those burgers would have been $30 easy...we also had crabs scuttling on a nearby wall as we ate, which I must say is a strange experience.

But the real star of the lunches were the Hula Pies.  We got multiple coupons at check-in for free Hula Pies with two entrees, so we were able to split three with the table each time.  Vanilla and macadamia nut ice cream topped with a hard chocolate shell and a sprinkling of nuts all on an Oreo cookie crust.  It was admittedly delicious.

Staff was also very friendly.  While Front Street felt like a giant tourist trap, this restaurant felt less so. So good on you.  And mahalo...or something.",Tim O.,"Garden Grove, CA",4.0 star rating

We ordered the poke appetizer and the macadamia nut calamari. Both were amazing! We also ordered the ""Fire-Roasted Vegetable Dip."" This was not great...we actually each took a bite and pushed it aside. We let the server know we didn't like it and she took it away. We finished the night with Hula Pie and it was awesome, as always. 

Here's why I can't give 5 stars,  when we got the bill, the dip was still on the check. We didn't want to make a fuss, so we just paid for it and left. I just wish the server had taken that extra step to get a manager involved to make sure we were happy.",Mary S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4.0 star rating

The side of fries and veggies were not very good, but the mashed potatoes looked pretty amazing. The hula pie with mint was really good! We split it with 8 people and each just had a bite, but it was so good. Overall, I'd say it was a bit overpriced, especially if your table doesn't have a view.

Although amidst all the tourist shops in Lahaina, this was a great place to stop and have a casual dinner! I had the Prime rib (14oz) end cut, with mixed vegetables, with a starter of Caesar salad. The salad was a bit limp, but a very lite Caesar dressing..which was OK...but the prime rib was fantastic. Juicy, tender, savory. You can't go wrong with that!",Mike M.,"La Habra, CA",4.0 star rating

Both were fantastic! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! The only thing I would say, the beans that come with the entrees were a bit too hard for my liking. We had the Hula Pie for dessert and it definitely lived up to its expectations. Our server Haley just killed it and knew the menu so well, if she didn't explain the fishes to us the way she did then I wouldn't have ordered a fish. She made it sound so delicious!

We were seated early which was awesome and our waiter was great. (curly dark hair, can't remember his name)

The drinks are good here, and the prices are standard.  We got the coconut shrimp app which comes with a great dipping sauce.  For dinner, we got the kimo style fish and the seared ahi. Both were good, not 5 star but good dishes. They also have great bread and butter to start you off.

It was my birthday, they have a song they sing and they gave us a hula pie which is a MUST. great way to end the meal.

9/8/2014,4.0 star rating,"Everything was great here, from the awesome view of the sunset to the drinks to the food. I was very happy with my experience at Kimo's. 

My boyfriend and I came here for our last dinner in Maui. We ordered the macadamia nut crusted calamari to start. It was very good. You get these large pieces of calamari to eat with this great cocktail sauce.

Each fish dish is created with a particular fish in mind. It may change daily according to the server and depending on the ingredients the chefs pair the fish with different sides and flavors. 

My boyfriend got the BAKED ""KIMO'S STYLE"" and it was paried with Mahi Mahi. He really enjoyed it

I got the LOBSTER TOPPED, it was a native hawaiian fish and I can't remember the name but it was nice, flaky, and buttery. I loved the little bit of lobster salad it had on top of it. It was paired with this really good wild rice. 

Last but not least, we got the famous Hula Pie. OMG this was to die for. I can't believe I ate it. As a person who is lactose intolerant was a terrible idea, but totally worth it It's this ice cream cake, piled high with fudge sauce and macadamia nuts drizzle on top. It was so good and totally worth all the guilt. 

I would totally reccomend Kimo's and would come back on another trip to Maui.",Stacey L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4.0 star rating
9/28/2016,1.0 star rating,"The view is really nice. They have a lot of servers that are very nice but the management of the restaurant is poor. They must be a micro manager because you can tell that the staff is concerned. Maybe at one point the place was run well but very poorly managed and the bar was slow and they kept taking people to tables and then it was not ready so they had to move them somewhere else. Food was ok but not great and for these prices, you want it to be at least very good.  Appetizer was a mystery. It was supposed to be seafood but not sure what it was and not able to ask. Everyone dashing about too much. They try to upsell you too. This is a tourist trap. I love to give good reviews but warning to all, even with reservations they are not going to be ready for you and until things change for the better you do not want to come here.

The prices are very reasonable for Maui. The coconut shrimp appetizer is excellent. I ordered the filet which was perfectly cooked  but vegetables needed a little more cooking as they were more on the raw side. We also ordered the Hawaiian version of snapper fish kimo style seasoning which wasn't bad also. The drinks were also good but not the best Mai Tai that I have had on the island. Friendly staff with pretty quick service. Overall I would eat here again . The bill was $138 and that was for two entrees appetizer and 4 good drinks.

We generally like T&S restaurants but after checking out menus for all four of their restaurants in Maui (Kimo's, Duke's, Leilani's on the Beach, and Hula Grill), we found that Kimo's was the only one that had both food and drink deals during aloha / happy hour, which makes it way more manageable and affordable to eat out with our kiddos. 

Loved the amazing view and that you can sit anywhere on the patio, not just at the bar. Service was incredibly friendly and nice, and very patient with our little ones. Lots of good appetizers on the happy hour menu, and some good options for kids as well.",Jen Y.,"Mountain View, CA",4.0 star rating

With the exception of the bartender (Oak Warriors fan) while we're waiting for our table, the service from the not-so-friendly hostesses (two older ladies) and the absentee server were dismal, and the food just plain awful. 

Fresh food is their motto? No way. We ordered the pull pork appetizers, it was bland with a topping of generic BBQ sauce on wilted lettuce, and the Maui vegetables side order...gross. Like a massive amount of green beans that looked & tasted suspiciously like it came from a frozen bag. I get the feeling, I may have had a better meal at Bubba Gumps down the way.

We've been on the island for a week and had some amazing meals. I recommend Merrimans for HH, Pacifico for lunch, and Mama's seafood in Paia for lunch & dinner.",chennie c.,"Oakland, CA",4.0 star rating

The fish menu explains the preparation types, then the server lets you know what the fresh catches are and how each is prepared that night. Don't get your heart set on a preparation until you know what (or if) a fish is being prepared that way that evening. 

The chowder was very good and a little lighter bodied than most, which added to the quality. There was plenty of good protein and other goodies in it to enjoy. The best plate of the night was the sweet potato/brussels sprouts hash. It has all sorts of goodness in it from a variety of vegetables. It's a very hearty side that will overpower some of the lighter fish flavors, so be aware, but still order it as it's fantastic!",Doug R.,"Victorville, CA",4.0 star rating

We didn't have reservations and were told the wait for a table was an hour and fifteen minutes, but we were able to sit at the bar immediately and we ended up just eating our dinner there.  I actually really appreciated it - because we were at the bar our ""waiter"" (George the bartender) was easily accessible whenever we needed anything.  And the bar was a great place to people watch.  The kahlua pork lettuce wrap appetizer was delicious but be forewarned - there are only three on the plate - my boyfriend and I carefully divided the third in half.  They were so good it would've been nice to each have two.  At George's recommendation we ordered the fresh caught fish prepared Kimo's style, which is served with rice pilaf and vegetables.  Wonderful.  I mean, so good.  The Hula Pie was GIANT and we left a big hunk of vanilla ice cream on the plate that we couldn't finish.  Next time we'll make reservations first and ask for one of the tables right on the water.

9/14/2014,4.0 star rating,"While visiting Hawai'i we had a nice meal at Kimo's in the town of Lahaina.  Our group had an excursion to Lanai and the departure town was Lahaina, where we planned on shopping and eating after our trip to the island.
We decided on Kimo's based on the Maui Revealed book.  I was so aggravated with the process of trying to find parking that my group dropped me off at the restaurant to get a head start.  We enjoyed pretty quick service and happy hour food.  I chose the Lobster Slider and a Pulled Pork Cheese Fries.  Lobster Slider was decadent.  A great bite.  My travel mates seemed very satisfied with their meals and drinks.  Thank you for the prompt service.  They seated a table of six, in the shade, no sweat.  Mostly the draft beer was the Kona and some Maui Brewing items with a few domestics.  I was pleased to see Lost Coast Indica IPA, a rarity.  

Vibe was relaxed and friendly.  Pretty views of the water.  All the diners seemed happy.  Two levels, not sure what happens upstairs.  I accidentally used the employee restroom.  The door to the hallway was open, I didn't know.  But their other restroom was sufficient and tidy.

8/15/2013,4.0 star rating,"This is such a difficult review to write.   Not because Kimo's isn't a beautiful restaurant, it is!  Not because I have difficulty describing the food... I didn't have any.    We went there for a glass of wine and to listen to Willie K on the advice of our friends at the Lahaina Yacht Club next door.   

What makes it difficult is that Willie K was quite amazing, this review is more about him than about Kimo's.   The restaurant experience was somewhat invisible, masked by Willie's amazing talent.   So I give the a default four stars because we did drink wine and it was quite good.  

I can't remember what night Willie K performs but make it a point to go... and go early as we had a hard time getting a table.   He is quite popular!    I don't know if I have heard a more verstile performer!!   Sings opera like Paverotti, plays the guitar like Jimmy Hendrix.    Whether he is playing rock or Hawaiian folk music... he is amazing!

There is a live band playing ""island"" music - the ambiance is PERFECT. Definitely a romantic place, but great for big groups as well.  The food was delicious, we all had the prime rib which was soooo good! The mashed potatoes are yummy and the steamed clams are a good choice for an appetizer.

However after having been on the island many times and this time for almost 2 weeks it occurs to me that their prices are high. My guess is this is because they have an amazing view over the water and they're only a handful of places that do here in downtown.
One 12 ounce beer will cost you seven dollars where you can go up the street to another nice place and get the same exact beer in a 22 ounce glass for the same price.

The restaurant is right on the water but we came here later so we didn't catch the sunset in the restaurant (caught it at the beach instead). I had my first lava flow here and it was amazing! I got more lava flows as the trip progressed, but the best one I had was here. Maui County is extremely strict with carding people, so make sure you have that ready! I traveled extremely light so I would always have to remember to bring it around if I planned on getting a drink.

The food was also really good. For their fish, they have different ways of serving the fish on the menu and the fish itself changes depending on the catches of the day. I got a lobster stuffed/topped fish and the lobster was also really good. We topped off our meal with a hula pie which was also delicious!

It's big enough for two. Look it up.
We had the Lobster Tristan and the Coconut Crusted Marlin. Wow! Both were cooked just right and delicious!

Sat on the 2nd floor overlooking the water with my family. I heard the view was amazing (unfortunately, I arrived too late to enjoy it). Besides the water, you would also see the mountains in the background.

8/13/2015,4.0 star rating,"We were here five times during our stay.  Twice for dinner and three times at the bar for drinks or appetizers.

The bartenders we had George and Paul were great.  Friendly and outgoing.

The food is properly prepared and very tasty.  We always have the fish, why not, we're in Hawaii.

Service in the restaurant was spotty.  The first night we felt rushed by the server and intentionally slowed things down.  I know they want to turn tables but.....

On our final night with family, a group of 8, we were seated at a table on the patio which was for six.  Very cramped. I let it go until we got the appetizers when they couldn't fit the three plates on the table I told our server we needed to make this table bigger.  He found the manager and they did bring over another table.

I know this is a busy restaurant but if you want to keep up both ends, food and service, these mistakes should not happen.

4/27/2013,5.0 star rating,"We arrived a bit before Happy Hour, where certain pupus (appetizers) were served at 1/2 price.

We had drinks before the Hour: Mai Tais and some fairly strong margaritas. But what was really great was the service: the waitress knew that the Happy Hour was what we were waiting for for the half price Macadamia Nut Calamari (breaded calamari served with house-made cocktail sauce--we liked this so much we ordered two) and also the Kalua/shredded Pork Lettuce wraps (Luau-style shredded pork, crisp iceberg lettuce, bbq plum sauce, pickled red onions and cilantro--very good).

So she waited to order and serve the fantastic Calamari right on the hour so that we got the Happy Hour pricing. Very cool! And it was a beautiful location right against the sea, with the waves literally lapping just inches away. 

Loved it. We didn't feel that this was one of the touristy strip places with high prices and low quality just to justify the location or the view. This was the real deal: the beautiful Pacific, at sunset served with very good food and drinks! 

Highly recommended (especially at Happy Hour)!",Glenn H.,"Pacifica, CA",4.0 star rating
9/1/2014,4.0 star rating,"My review is for happy hour.
during happy hour the prices are good.
Lobster sandwich ($5-6) light and fresh. Came with perfectly fried truffle chips. You can see chunks of meat. I think the sandwich could use a lighter bread. I would eat it as a lobster lettuce wrap! 4 stars

Macadamia crusted Calamari ($5-6) - i expected a lightly battered calamari but its thick pieces of squid with a thick batter. The horseradish sauce was good but you better like horseradish. 2-3stars

House margarita ($5) - lime margarita that's just right! 5 stars

Lemonade cocktail ($6) - couldn't taste the vodka it was like drinking plain lemonade, albeit good lemonade. 3 stars

Service - 5 stars

Location - right on the ocean! 5 stars

Had two fantastic fish dishes and my daughter had a Caesar salad with chicken. The chicken was teriyaki chicken. No mention of this when ordering. It was odd pairing.

6/22/2014,4.0 star rating,"One of the things that you MUST do in Maui is have Hula Pie, and Kimo's is the place to go!  The Hula Pie is such a Maui institution that it has it's own plate and SPORK; Col. Sanders would be so proud. We ate in the lounge for dinner, we didn't want to eat to heavy and the food was very good. 

The steak and wedge and fish and chips were good, the fish was outstanding, but the fries were under whelming. My daughter got the calamari for dinner and loved it, what would make it even better is some sort of Island twist, perhaps in the coating for the batter or in the dipping sauce. The smoked fish bruschetta was good, but overpriced for just 3 pieces, I wouldn't order it again. 

Our server, Caroline, was great and very accommodating, even taking the time to balance a wobbly table. The atmosphere was awesome! Who doesn't love watching the sunset on a beautiful Maui evening!",Scott S.,"Granite Bay, CA",4.0 star rating

8/13/2015,3.0 star rating,"I got the blackened ahi and while the fish wasn't disappointing, the rest of the entrée was. I think what they described as a ""Thai sweet chili vinaigrette"" was really Wishbone Italian Dressing. If not they're probably putting too much effort into making what really tastes like cheap Italian dressing. I didn't completely hate it. In fact, I put Italian dressing on things all the time. But when I'm spending a lot on a chef-made meal I expect something more. 

The service was great and our servers were attentive and enthusiastic. 

This was my second trip to Kimo's and, although I don't remember what I ordered the first time, I do remember that I enjoyed it. Still, I probably won't go back unless I'm with a group that insists.",Eric F.,"Middlesex, MA",4.0 star rating

Last time here we went three times, because we enjoyed it so much.  Known for their great prime rib, and also Ahi,  we were looking forward to one of our favorite dinners. My husband's 14 ounce prime rib looked like a thin slice of roast beef..not prime rib. Flavor was good, presentation sub par. My Ahi came out instead of being a nice thick piece, it looked like they sliced it in half and gave me two small little portions. It went back. Replacement meal gave me stomach issues all night.  Ahi tower appetizer was good. More ahi in it at $17 than my dinner @ $34. Best part of dinner was our amazing server Neli...five star server.

Very odd and all of us couldn't figure it out even after it was explained. Just say the type of fish people! Luckily I don't eat seafood! The ribs and loaded baked potato were delicious, also Kalua pork lettuce wraps were yummy. Only complaint was the food seemed like it sat there for a min and wasn't hot enough. Hula pie looks amazing so I was bummed I was too stuffed to try it! It's a little pricey but definitely worth it for a good meal one night when in Lahaina.",Amanda S.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

We were sat right on the edge of the upper level overlooking the sunset.

The food was delicious, my boyfriend had the prime rib which was just....so good. So so good. I had the rosemary roasted chicken with delicious goat cheese polenta. Mmmmm!!!

11/23/2016,3.0 star rating,"We went here for the location and the oceanfront patio.  And that's about all we got.  Admittedly we only ate from the bar menu, as the dinner menu forced us to eat from a large window enclosed upstairs area and we were more interested in the beautiful open air lower patio. The drinks were okay. The calamari were thick tough cuts and the poke was more avacodo than ahi and missing a key ingredient listed on the menu.  The fish and chips were dry, tough, and over fried.

I was not even expecting a ""New England"" style clam chowder to be on an Hawaiian menus so it was a double surprise to  when the flavors were found to be so rich. My wife and I shared the Parmesan crusted fish of the day (a local dish which I forget the name of) and it was seasoned perfectly!  We were treated to the Hula Pie for desert and I was like ""WHAT!!!""  I debated between 4 and 5 stars and the only thing that kept me from going with the 5 stars were: 1) it was very warm in the corner we were seated and 2) I thought the all around service was very good, but not great.

Kalua pork fries.... Filling and savory. Delicious.

Potato skins, large wedges topped with gooey cheddar cheese, crisp bacon bits and  green onions.

Entrees were $32 - $35 for standard fish. Caesar salads were $7. Total for two was $102 with tip ( no alcohol).

The burger was good and you could tell it was freshly ground, but nothing I would go out of the way for. It came with a handful of fries.

But still - amazing value considering we were sitting right on the water, the portions were generous (the mahi mahi might look small on the plate, but trust me it's plenty). The meal also comes with delicious rolls and carrot muffins. The cocktails were strong. The grog was very good and gingery. The Mai tai was huge and strong - my bf and I shared one since we were driving home.

Make sure you grab a coupon that's floating around for a free slice of hula pie. It's enormous. Could probably be enough for a family of 4. You can google it or grab one at the museum down by the pioneer inn. I'm not much of a dessert person but that pie is so delicious - the ice cream is creamy and not too sweet, the macadamia nuts were so fragrant and crunchy, the fudge was rich and not too sugary...yum. 

Pop in during the day and make a reservation for 5:30. Perfect amount of time to finish dinner and watch the sunset. 

There's also lovely live music - the Hawaiian guitarists played some Carlos Santana, and it was perfect in combination with the sound of crashing waves and the lit tiki torches.",Fiona X.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

4/9/2015,5.0 star rating,I cannot say enough how wonderful this place is. I came here on a whim with my husband and some friends I haven't seen here in 20 years. We were able to find a place at the bar even though it was a very crowded night. We got amazing service and never had to wait for a drink our food was superb. we ordered raw fish deep fried food and several different types of hors d'oeuvres. The second time I came we brought different sets of friends and they enjoyed it just as much as the first. It wasn't as crowded and the bartenders had even more of an opportunity to be very interactive.

He's so nice, asked if we've been here before and when we said no, he gave us a description of every item on the menu. Poor guy has to do that all night and he does it with a big smile. We went with his recommendation of the Mothers day special. Amazing Mahi Mahi  with a crispy risotto. I also ordered the beet salad with arugala and melt in your mouth goat cheese, which was crazy delicious. And the kahlua pork lettuce wraps were soooo good. The hula pie was yummy too if u have room.

4/17/2015,4.0 star rating,"My wife and I dined her in April. We were lucky to have made reservations, and there was a 1 hour walk-in wait time. It was after sunset, but sitting outside on the upstair's terrace was still quite relaxing with the ocean breeze, tiki torches, and whatnot adding ambience. Our waitress was young and energetic, and very much into making sure we had a good time (as we were, in part, celebrating my wife's birthday, which was a few days away).

We split the kalua pork lettuce wrap appetizer, which was flavorful but could have used more pickled onions. The roasted vegetable app my wife had was on the average side, but my wedge salad with local produce was very fresh and tasty. For mains she had the seafood cioppino, which had a light tomato broth with just the right amount of peppery flavor on the back end. I had a local fish in basil crust, which was served with fabulous rice pilaf (so much so that I actually have to comment on it, it was that good), and a side of asparagus. Both mains were quite good, much better than the apps. They also surprised us with a ice cream cake slice (vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and crushed macadamia nuts) for her birthday, on the house. 

There area a lot of places geared for the tourist crowd in old Lahaina, and especially on Front St. Kimo's is technically one of them, but the meal itself was, in that sense, better than it needed to be (the restaurant was jam-packed every night). Kudos to Kimo's for a very nice meal and night out. We would definitely return in the future if our travels ever brought us back to the island.",Michael G.,"Tallahassee, FL",4.0 star rating

My husband had the fish and chips made with the very meaty and tasty Opa (moon fish) that is popular here in Maui. I had the Kimo burger with grilled pineapple and delicious teriyaki sauce.

11/29/2014,3.0 star rating,"I almost didn't write this review, because our server and manager really went out of their way to try to rectify our experience, but I cannot in good conscience not share my experience with others.

This restaurant is without a doubt a tourist attraction in the midst of tourist trap galore. However, ALL of the staff, greeters, hostess, beverage server, waitress, manager, other servers are all really, really gracious and warm.  They, and the beautiful view, are two of the stars in this review. In fact, were the staff not close to perfection, this would most definitely be a 2 star review based on the food preparation and pricing alone. 

We ordered calamari for a starter, and this dish epitomizes why Kimo's got a third star; the calamari is the most tender and succulent I have ever had.  And the breading on it was completely bland and tasteless.  Here we had beautiful, tender, fresh calamari, completely underwhelmingly prepared without a single iota of salt, or any seasoning whatsoever.  While I was impressed by the wonderful choices on the kids' menu, my two always hungry children would not finish their ribs.  

The rolls provided on the table were also completely tasteless and lacking in salt. My husband and I split the Caesar, but it was wilted and the croutons were hard and stale. 

For my entree I ordered the fresh fish-- Ono- topped with lobster, with rice and vegetables.  It was $31.  I expected a beautiful piece of fish.  What I got was a small, incredibly dry, over-cooked piece of fish with the equivalent of two tablespoons of lobster on top.   It was so dry the edges were crispy.  The rice was complete and total mush, and they actually put the scraped out brown part from the bottom of the pot on my plate .  Surprisingly, the vegetables were well cooked, beautifully actually.  So I ate all the veg and about half my fish, because I was really hungry.  Until
I got really pissed thinking about how much we were paying. My husband seemed to like his; I tasted it and HIS fish wasn't overcooked but the Thai sweet chili sauce on top was overpowering the fish. Just sweet, sweet and sweet. 

I decided to tell the waitress so she would know, but I told her I didn't expect her to take my meal off the bill because I had eaten half of it.  She apologized, and after about 5 minutes the manager showed up with this huge piece of the Hula pie as a gesture of goodwill.  The waitress also took my entree off the bill, which was a pleasant surprise.  Since this all took a few minutes I imagine they took the time to examine the food left on my plate and realized I wasn't exaggerating. 

Unfortunately, despite the manager's assertions that people really liked the icecream pie.....the icecream in the Hula pie was freezer burned.  My kids gobbled it up anyway, but it was not edible to me.

So, I give this place 3 stars with reservations-- honestly, it wouldn't pass muster in comparison to the touristy restaurants in the Bay Area, but the service really was quite good.  For families taking a well earned vacation in Maui, however, this is a rip off-- better to take your hard earned dollars elsewhere.",Wtf D.,"Oakland, CA",4.0 star rating
1/20/2015,4.0 star rating,"If you're looking for a relaxed atmosphere, with good food, a nice view and that won't break the bank, Kimo's is your place. 

As you can imagine, you can go quite broke eating in Hawaii and so you learn to get tips from the locals where they go when they want a night out but don't want to spend tourist trap dollar amounts on mediocre food. Kimo's was the recommendation we got and it was a good call.

We originally were going to get a table but opted for seats at the bar as you could still get a nice menu served there and there was live music. Oh, and we were overlooking the sunset. Yes, please!

Service (at least at the bar) was great and the staff was super friendly and attentive. Draft selection was solid with good local choices and the food was good too. Had calamari but not like you're used to. This wasn't like you get on the mainland in small little rings. This was the tentacle so it looked more like a mozzarella stick than calamari but man was it good! Also enjoyed the fish tacos served with a side of chip. Between the app and the tacos, it was enough for my wife and I to enjoy as a dinner and still leave room for ice cream.

Between the food and 2 drinks each, it only set up back $42. Which is a bargain in Hawaii! May go back and try the main dining room next time we visit but if you're looking fr a reasonable pit stop with some food and a few drinks with a nice view, eat at the bar at Kimo's.

I will say that we had a nice sunset while we ate, and the view is unbeatable.  The service was pretty good and friendly.

The best part of the meal was the COCONUT SHRIMP.  Everyone at the table thought they were the best shrimp they've ever had, including me.  That's a definitely must-order if you like shrimp.

My wife and I split the OPAKA PAKA fish plate and it was good.

My daughter had the ahi tuna appetizer as her entree and we all tasted it and no one was impressed.

For dinner we ate the center cut filet which came with locally frown vegetables (which I guess is common on an Island, not so much where I come from).  The food was amazing.

One of the few places on Maui that I found quinoa on the menu, as a side to the Fresh Island Fish.  I'd say the Coconut Crusted Island Fish could use even more coconut flavor, but still enjoyed it nonetheless.

It did not occur to us that this was another Duke's chain until we ordered drinks. I commented to the bartender that TS Corp must own half of Maui and he replied ""Only the better half"". 
40 minute wait to get a table.  We noticed that the staff was friendly but not very local (if you catch my drift).  Our table was on the top overlooking the bay. It was pitch black by this time but it was still nice with the tiki torches. 
We ordered the Iceberg & Bleu Cheese Salad. Nice twist in that it included walnuts and pineapple. Small, but they probably have to ship iceberg in.  We also ordered the Fresh Au (Parmesan and Citrus Herb styles). The sides were typical fare; rice pilaf and veggies.  The meal was cooked to corporate  perfection.  We also ordered their famous Hula Pie. It was presented well, but nothing about it was particularly memorable. It's just a macadamia nut flavored ice cream pie with an Oreo crust.

Now you fellow food-enthusiasts will understand when I say that meals are sacred on vacation. You have so few, so you feel pressure to choose wisely! We only had 6 dinners on our recent trip to Maui and I SO regret wasting one on Kimo's.

We were seated on the second floor in the open air which was nice. We were there for 15 minutes before our server made it to our table.

The service was...bizarre: We had this waitress with a thick accent and she just had this script in her mind of all the things she was supposed to say and she ran through it without interruption like a robot. When I asked her a question it was like she had a system malfunction and went right back to the script. ""I'm sorry, how did you say the mahi mahi was prepared?"" ""Our delicious mahi mahi is truly a dish to try. It is a signature item here at Kimo's and it comes prepared with...."" Creepy. 

Service continued to be slow and by the time we received our food, we had been there an hour. Even more odd: the food was cold!

We go to Maui a lot for work but never took the time to treat ourselves too a very nice dinner before. After reading all these wonderful reviews,  we decided to make a reservation at Kimo's.  We got seated at a beautiful ocean view table for two upstairs and received the best food advices from our server Jim. He was so knowledgeable and a pleasure to talk to. My grilled fish came with a sauce so exquisite I would have cleaned my plate with the warm and doughy bread rolls if I had been in the privacy of my own home.... Don't skip on the fried calamari either. They are lightly breaded with spices,  crunchy and not greasy at all. Delicious (and I NEVER eat fried food). Dessert,  you HAVE to order a slice of their famous Hula Pie. A gigantic slice of Vanilla bean ice cream covered in chocolate fudge,  macadamia nuts and whipped cream will be brought to you,  and I can assure you,  you will not be able to forget about this sensational ""little"" piece of heaven! Jim suggested some Maui coffee to go with it,  and we loved it. Much better than ""that Kona coffee""....   '-)

I recommend sitting at the bar if you want to have some fun ;) My fiancé and I stopped by without a reservation and the place was packed. Bar seating was our only option, but I'm glad it worked out that way. Not only were our bartenders speedy and informative, but we had fun chatting with our neighbors. Trying most of the drinks on the menu was likely a factor, but it was fun nonetheless. On to the food. We had coconut shrimp as an appetizer, nut crusted mahi mahi for our entrees, and hula pie for dessert. The coconut shrimp was- no joke- the best I have ever had. I would recommend a stop at Kimo's for those alone. The fish was fresh, but the crust on top was a bit soggy... that could use some work. The hula pie was pretty awesome though. It is basically a monster-sized ice cream sundae in pie form. It was fun to share, although the gooey fudge sauce, whipped topping, and mac nuts were worth spoon-fighting for!

12/26/2015,5.0 star rating,"I wasn't sure that I would return after my last disappointing visit to Kimo's but was convinced by my father and some reassurance from the management team at Kimo's that it couldn't be as bad as the last time.

Once again we made a reservation for the top deck hoping to catch the fantastic sunsets that you always get in Lahaina.  Well, there is another island in the way, so you won't see it hit the water this time of year, but the sky does look fantastic.

So if you go with a party of four, you have a very slim chance of sitting on the rail, since there is only one or two tables that seat that many with that location.  This is fine since the romantic aspect is really saved for couples, not large parties.  Ok by me.

Everything was 100% better this time around.  Our server, Ina, was great.  She knew the menu, she knew the offerings, she knew what each fish was and how the consistency would be.  Now I know that should be expected at a place serving fish, but most can not actually verbalize it the correct way.  And even though there were suggested preparations for each fish, you could chose whichever was going to make you happy.  This policy either changed from our last visit or was not properly told to us, but this is the way that it should be.

We started with some appetizers, calamari and smoked fish plate.  The smoked fish really surprised me with how good it was.  Great job!  Calamari was typical, but that is what my father and his friend wanted, so be it, well executed.
The entree fish was a much larger portion then our last visit.  I would not say it was huge, but this time it was very fair, very typical of what each restaurant will serve you at that price point.  This also was a great improvement over the last trip.
You absolutely have to finish the meal with a Hula Pie.  Just do it, say no more.

I am very happy to report that Kimo's is back in the rotation.  Every part of my meal that left me disappointed last trip was improved.  Knowledgeable server.  The manage on duty that night, Caroline, made sure we had a great experience, she showed she cared about our meal.

I would recommend getting here early and asking for a spot on the rail. They have tables set up so you can enjoy your dinner while watching the sunset.

I was not a huge fan of the margaritas so I would not recommend those, but they do have a large selection of other mixed drinks. The mixer was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but it was still an excellent experience. The service was also excellent.",Cliff P.,"Pleasanton, CA",4.0 star rating
11/18/2015,4.0 star rating,"Recently visited this establishment on our vacation. One of our friends suggested we see the sunset there after seeing it rise on Haleakala earlier that morning. I have to say, from the get-go, the service was on point. Got seated right away in the upstairs for a great view overlooking the beach. The waiter attended our table right away. I would have to say that the drink menu wasn't filled with the options I'm used to (could've used a Manhattan) but nevertheless, there were good choices on there. Being that Maui establishments are known to have great seafood with their ""catch of the day"", my wife and I had the Mahi Mahi and the red snapper dishes. Simple, yet very fresh and tasty! If I recall, we had the chocolate ice cream dessert! Fantastic!!! One serving is enough for two!

Tried out the coconut crusted mahi, and my wife had a teryaki glazed sirloin steak.  Both items were good.  For dessert, we tried the Hula pie.

I didn't want to leave they were that good. My husband had the prime rib which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the coconut curry tofu dish. Seriously yum. I made some modifications to it and the bartenders and kitchen were very accommodating. The views here are spectacular and the ambience outside is second to none.

I'm giving this place a five star totally because of the surprising Uncle Willie K band's live show on the Friday night. Uncle Willie K was so good that he really masters different styles so well. At one moment he might be rocking Bob Dylan, and five seconds later he might be gently weeping island style.

Their prime rib is massive and delicious, it's my husbands staple dish. I usually opt for the fresh catch of the day and am always pleased. If you aren't too full when it's time for dessert you must order the Hula Pie, it's the perfect end to a great meal.

12/1/2015,4.0 star rating,Definitely a wonderful place that we can always count on for a great meal. We tried something new tonight - made a reservation for 5:00 and had about ten minutes of too hot sun and then the rest of our dinner was perfect and magical sunset. Outdoor seating with a picture friendly view. We got calamari and sashimi  for apps and all four different types of fish. My favorite was the Thai one and my husband loved the Parmesan crusted with capers. Kids split Mac and cheese - only fail of the night. It was cold and nasty. Finished with hula pie and chefs choice hula pie which was pumpkin ice cream and caramel sauce. Totally worth the calories. Perfect night.

4/30/2015,5.0 star rating,"Really enjoyed Kimo's, second most of the dinners in Lahaina that we visited outside our resort.

Excellent meals and drinks, with the only slight disappointment being I requested a seat near the edge of the patio for sunset when I placed my reservation and again when we arrived, yet we still were seated near the building wall, behind a tree and multiple other tables for what proved to be a less than stellar view when sunset arrived.

Setting this aside, wonderful service and great food for both my wife and I... just a tiny fraction less satisfied than at Lahaina Fish Co, and slightly better than Koa and Leilani's.

Of the four, my ratings:

Lahaina Fish Co.- 4.7

However, Kimo's shined at making Mai Tai's. They handled the crowds on Halloween terrifically. It was nuts in there and they were all over it. After a couple of drinks and the controlled craziness of Halloween on Front street, we went back for a drink and decided to have a burger and fries. They rocked the burgers! Kind of wish that whoever had prepped the burgers had taken care of the fish we had a few nights prior.

We ordered the coconut shrimp as an appetizer. It was tasty, but the breading was a bit dry and heavy. My caprese sandwich entree was delicious and filling, and my husband even commented that I must have loved it, because I didn't even offer him a bite! (I almost never finish my entrees, but this one was too good not to finish!) My husband ordered the caesar salad with the teriyaki chicken, and he seemed to enjoy it as well.

My wife gave high marks to the Mai Tai and Lava Flow which is important as she has been sampling those drinks all over Kaanapali coast! 

My only deduction in a star is the 'aloha hour' menu. The second time we were there, we really wanted the lobster slider and Kailua pork slider. Little did we know that the $5 on the menu is only for ONE slider each! Not a great value if you ask me. Short ribs were limited in supply so we couldn't order those.

Waiter didn't even ask if the guys in our group wanted a refill on their beer. Lastly, he asked our friend if he was finished with his ribeye and our friend said no. So why did this moran take his horseradish? Not paying attention!!! 

Food, on the other hand was enjoyed by the group. The fish was delicious, the ribeye was cooked a nice medium rare. Beware! Do NOT order cioppino!!!!

I had the Fresh Island Fish plate. ""It's what made Kimo's famous"" says the menu. Well then, that's what I'll be having for lunch! Lordy was that fish well prepared! It comes in a sweet basil lemon and garlic glaze. I'll be honest that that's not what I actually tasted. I don't really know what flavors were dancing on my tongue, just that it tasted delicious! The fish was tender and juicy, and not quite what I remembered Mahi Mahi to taste like. If anything, it was better than what I had imagined.

Other great dishes: The koloa pork ribs, the fish taco (a generous piece of likewise amazingly prepared fish in a large flour tortilla), and beer battered fish n' chips.

Their pina coladas and mai tais come with tiny umbrellas! A cute little touch for our Hawaiian getaway.

Sauce was slightly sweet. We were upstairs - nice view. Service was good and prompt. Prices in Hawaii are high and this was no exception. Touristy with a shop for T shirt sales at the entrance.

If you sit in the bar area; there's no wait for a table, but you only get a limited bar menu. No problem for us - we decided to share the Ahi Poke appetizer & Kalua Pork Sandwich. I had a glass of red wine and my BF had a beer.

There was live entertainment, which was nice - a couple of local guys (cousins) singing Hawaiian/island music along with some oldies. They were very good and I wish I could remember their names - I want to say one of them is Benny?

Our food came out and it was all very tasty! I liked the Ahi Poke, mainly because there was avocado in it! And the Kalua Pig was also good - moist in flavor and not overpowered with sauce.

When the entertainment was done with their set, my BF gave them a tip and a little while after, the singer cam up to talk to us (he was going around to the tables in the bar area to talk story and see where everyone was from).  He thanked us for coming and asked where we were from - he was very excited and shouted to his cousin that we were from Oahu!  We talked story for a bit and my BF told him that we were looking for Foodland, but couldn't find it and he explained to us where it was.  OMG we only parked like right around the corner from it in front of the Maui Theater!  Haha!

Wife had the teriyaki steak which I thought was a little heavy on the sauce but she enjoyed it. I had the kimos style mahi mahi which was also tasty but I wouldn't say it was the best fish I've ever had (although it was the most I've ever paid for a piece of fish that size). Was told that the fish came with rice and veggies, and I ordered a baked potato hoping it would come in addition to those two, but the waitress instead substituted the rice out but still charged full price for the potato add-on.

4/28/2014,2.0 star rating,"We came here after hearing about their famous Hula Pie, and were pretty surprised to see how ""fancy"" the place was.  I saw their dinner prices, cringed a little, and prayed to the heavens that the food was worth the bill I was gonna have at the end of the night... (spoiler***)... it wasn't.

We ordered based off of the waitresses recommendations for the day, which ended up being a ""snapper like delicacy local to Maui"" (can't remember the name of the actual fish) with garlic lemon sweet basil, and a more firm fish (again I can't remember the name) with coconut crusting, mango, and peanut sauce.  Also, as an appetizer, I added their Macadamia-Crusted Calamari ($12).  Each fish entree was $34 if I remember correctly.

Calamari: decent, just decent, and not nearly enough.

soft/flaky fish dish w/lemon basil: we both agreed this was the better of the two dished, but neither of us were really crazy about it at all...

firm fish w/coconut crust, mango, and peanut sauce: nothing special.  I've had much better plates at the Cheesecake Factory and paid half as much...

Last, but NOT LEAST... the table we were seated at, was upstairs right next to the door that constantly swings open with servers running in and out.  It was also in a strange spot, kinda awkwardly placed, to where we never really got comfortable.  Too much noise, too many servers going in and out of the kitchen... it was hard to enjoy the dinner in this spot, and I know they're trying to seat as many people as possible, but I would've rather waited a bit more and then get a nicer table than to have to sit at that spot... it really was a shitty spot, and with the prices we paid for that dinner, we deserved good seating.

The only good thing I can say about this place, is that their Hula Pie is excellent.  Worth the notoriety and recognition.  Their food however, fell short of expectations, and wasn't even something I'd consider ""good,"" but with a price tag of great.  

If you're coming here for a Hula Pie, as I was, hopefully you hear my words and benefit from my mistake... eat elsewhere, and come here afterwards, then get the Hula Pie to-go.",Nick G.,"Sacramento, CA",4.0 star rating
3/21/2014,4.0 star rating,"Went to Kimo's for lunch while walking down Front Street doing a little shopping. First off, the view is great, can't beat the waterfront seating and we were even a few tables deep. Server was friendly and very helpful. 

They have a couple local brews on tap that change frequently, which I like better than the standard domestic beers that you can find anywhere. I had the fish and chips for lunch. The fish was not greasy at all, had a nice crunch, and great flavor. Of course the fish was fresh, how could it not be? And the fries were good too. No grease, and cooked perfectly. 

For dessert there's only one thing you can try, the Hula Pie. How could you not try something with its own plate and silverware? It's much too much for just one person to eat though, it was even too much for myself and my wife to finish off. So be sure you have some friends to help you eat it!

View from the bar was pictureseque. There was an older Hawaiian performer the evening I went. He sang Billy Joel and Sinatra, but was almost inaudible.

Standing alone, I think the food warrants two stars. I came here for lunch on a nice sunny day after walking around Lahaina. We were given a table right on the rail so there were no complaints there.

I ordered the plate lunch dish. This was like a teriyaki type thing with globs of rice and macaroni salad. Here in NY, we call it a bento box (haha). Was the food special or noteworthy? No. I could have had something similar which was just as good at any hole in the wall Japanese place for ten bucks. We did have a hula pie which was tasty but really only a glop of ice cream with whipped cream so I don't know what everybody gets so excited for....

Will I return, maybe, maybe not. There are other similar places to go in Lahaina that I might take a chance on before returning. I think you have to go into this place with measured expectations.

We dine out quite a bit and the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars is that the food/ambiance was mediocre for the price... I get that it is a touristy area (We live in a VERY touristy area) but prices were still a bit steep for what you're getting...

Of course you have to try the hula pie! They also had a chef's special flavor which was coconut and guava. I didn't try it though.

5/16/2014,4.0 star rating,"Had dinner here on our last night in Maui. Finding the restaraunt wasn't hard, it was the parking and navigating through tourist/pedestrian traffic. When they say Front St is the ""tourist spot"" they werent kidding (which is why we stayed away from it for most of our trip).

Since we had reservations the wait wasn't long and we were seated upstairs overlooking the water. The ambience was a little noisy because several large parties were present.

As for the food, we tried the ono, mahi mahi, and the seafood stew. All were delicious, not too salty or under spiced. My kids loved the bread/muffins given.

We were given 2 vouchers for free Hula Pie from a nearby parking lot attendant but opted not to get the dessert.

It was pricey but when you are dining around a ""tourist trap"" area of course prices will be high.

Dinner was a lobster covered local fish with sautéed vegetables.  Very nicely presented and tasty.  Our other dinner was a 14oz. prime rib with local vegetables and a baked potato.  The beef was very good and tender--not always the case with prime rib.  On the downside the steak knife was more dull than the butter knives.  I asked for a replacement and it was just as bad.  This sort of takes away from the tenderness of the prime rib when you have to hack away at it.  Come on Kimo's, at those prices you can afford a sharp steak knife.

Person I met this whole trip, so nice and kind ! :) 

The reason why I put only 3 stars is the food quality, we ordered the Ahi poke with avocado and it was warm and slimy, this was my only indulgence during my pregnancy and thought I could get fresh fish here :( 

The rest of my order was okay and lacked salt. Husband ordered the prime rib and loved it! The smashed potatoes are very yummy! But then again, lack of salt with veggies.

I had a good Mai Tai, and my hubby had 2 draft beers, We both had the roasted beet salad, healthy and delicious.  I had the mongchong with Kimo's preparation and my husband had same fish with citrus prep.  Both were very fresh, moist, a decent portion size, and came with a nice rice pilaf and sautéed asparagus. If you love fresh fish, I'd definitely recommend it. For downtown Lahaina, the price was decent for what we had, a little over $100. We had the Hula Pie for dessert, which was great. We showed the waiter the coupon for free hula pie you can get on an Internet search on your phone, and that's enough to get it. 
Service was great. I'd  recommend making a reservation, the earlier the better. The only down side is no AC like many restaurants in Maui, so it was a bit too hot for me, even sitting under an overhead fan. Overall happy with Kimos once again.",Cathy S.,"Fremont, CA",4.0 star rating

Tropical Itch is a great and tasty alternative to a Mai Tai. 

The food - we tried twice, once for lunch and lunch for dinner. Husband had the hamburger he said it was pretty good. Best thing he had here but nothing extra ordinary. I had the fish sandwich. It was okay, pretty standard, A small strip of  fish on a huge bun. The fries were standard and nothing interesting. 

Dinner was the real kicker. Our waiter was obviously disinterested, not engaged, and really not very helpful. I ordered the Marlon, which came coconut crusted with a thai peanut sauce that completely overwhelmed the fish. it was served with a side of limp vegetables and under seasoned rice pilaf.

Had a great experience this time around. Was seated on the 2nd floor. The host and server were very nice. We first received complimentary bread and carrot muffins. Yummy. Then we split a Caesar salad. This was very good as well.

I had the Kimo style Mahi Mahi which included rice pilaf and asparagus and tomatoes, husband had Parmesan crusted Opa with mixed vegetables and rice pilaf. The rice pilaf was absolutely delicious. I wish I could make this at home. I couldn't pinpoint the ingredients, but I could have eaten this by itself. Both fish were very tender, but I did like the Parmesan crust because of the slight crispiness. 

We then had the Hula Pie. OMG, the thing was HUGE. 4-5"" high, crust was like an oreo crust, the body was macadamia nut ice cream, a layer of fudge(?) and then topped with macadamia nuts. Also came with a side of whipped cream and hot fudge. Delicious, but only get it if you are not stuffed.

We had a reservation, and were quickly seated upstairs on a large balcony with live music playing below.

Both of us were a little drank out- so we stuck to water. The selection was good for wine by the glass.

Our server Paige ran us through the fish specials, I ended up getting the 14 oz Prime Rib and Matt got the Lobster stuffed Mahi Mahi with a added on baked potato. 

My Prime Rib was the perfect mid rare, with a salty crust, it came with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. The bread is also really tasty, mini French loaves. Matt for sure needed the added on potato since the fish just came with rice and veggies. We shared some of our food and the fish was awesome.

I got a decaf coffee and we split the Hula Pie- but could not finish it. It was really good- we had it at Dukes the week before.

But that doesn't really matter because the seafood was absolutely spectacular.  Everyone at the table ordered a different type of fish and each prepared differently.  I took bites from each plate and everything was truly delicious.  8 months later and I'm still craving for their Tilapia baked ""Kimo's"" style, which I had ordered.  The fish was cooked so perfectly that it crumbled and melted in my mouth.  My mother-in-law ordered fish (can't remember which one) topped with lobster and that was delicious too.

They don't have reservations via opentable.com which I find quite weird... so I ended up calling in and making sure to mention that we're celebrating my folk's 40th Wedding Anniversary. 

We got there an hour early and of course our table wasn't ready and we expected it to be... I decided to get drinks for the parental unit... a Kimo's Mai Tai for my Dad and a virgin Mango Colada for my mom. Since they were hungry... and fortunately a couple of seats opened up by the bar... we ended up getting a Macadamia Nut Calamari. With the drinks... calamari and the live music playing in the background... the parents were definitely enjoyed it. 

We got seated exactly at 7:45... our server being Tracey ... the night was flawless. My mom ordered the TRISTAN LOBSTER TAILS and she actually finished half of it. She said that it was cooked well and was glad that she ordered it. My dad was very happy with his SASHIMI... portion was perfect for him. 

I ended up ordering the mahi mahi cooked in Kimo's style. Lo and behold... I too finished my food! First time I ever finished my food here! 

Folks... their mai tai and mojito... you can't go wrong! They make them well and stiff but you can't taste the alcohol - but you can definitely feel it if you order a lot like I did! 

To the management... good job on having such attentive and friendly staff. From the bartenders... to everyone else... being busy in a touristy spot ... staff could get moody and such but every time I've been here... always the friendly faces.

Kimo's sits right on the water; in fact, I witnessed one of the waitresses pouring out a patron's unconsumed water over the balcony and directly into the ocean.  So needless to say, their fish is fresh and the view is unparalleled.  I enjoyed my fish tacos in the afternoon.

As with everywhere else in Maui, vegetarian fare can be tricky to come by, but some healthier options are available off-menu, so don't be afraid to ask.  You might want to save room for the Hula Pie at the end, which is the size of a hula dancer.  I was surprised at the dent I was able to make into it.",Adam W.,"Grandview, Glendale, CA",4.0 star rating

Some of my favorite family dinners have been here and they have the best carrot muffins in the whole world... we usually ask for a dozen to go and then have them for breakfast the next day they are so moist and flavorful and they are just part of the free bread basket!!!

Our last visit the food wasn't very good and we thought it was a fluke...but sadly after another bad meal last night this place seems to have really gone down in quality. The waitress read off the fish selections so quickly we couldn't even catch what she said. The fish I did end up ordering was extremely over cooked and dry. My husband got the ribs and they were so fatty he wasn't sure if there was any meat on the bone. Even the calamari we started with was cold as if it had been sitting in a bin for hours.

You will have to spend a pretty penny but that's hardly different from anywhere in Maui.  My recommendation: the ahi poke and avocado tower to start, and the Koloa pork ribs with plum BBQ sauce for dinner.  Quite possibly the best ribs on the island.  We were given very on point service with consideration of our space.  Our orders were delivered timely and we never had to flag a server down.

However, our dining experience over the past couple of years have been disappointing compared to prior years.  On our most recent visit this year in 2016, our food was not served hot for any of the five people in our party.  It wasn't overly crowded so there was no acceptable reason why they could not get our meals to the table in a prompt fashion. For the price, we expected the dinner to be higher quality and not lukewarm.  Perhaps going at lunch would be a better and less expensive option. Maybe they have changed owners? If not, hopefully they will once again return to serving the quality food and service that we once enjoyed at Kimo's.",Angela W.,"Oracle, AZ",4.0 star rating

Servers rely on a drink crew to provide drinks and water and soda refills. What this means is you can go for 15 to 20 minutes to get a refills of a beverage.

This venue sits right in the middle of the Lahaina Front Street action. It's a can't miss place for all first time Maui visitors.

The food here is great! Lots of seafood options, all with a Hawaiian twist.  They also have burgers and pub grub.

Picture this -  a balmy, breezy late-March evening, a local band playing, with sound of gentle waves hitting the sand beneath the deck we were on. Our server Sherri was the epitome of the Aloha spirit. She checked on us frequently and our drinks were magically refilled without us asking. My fruity umbrella drink hit the spot. 

My brother in law and I got the Kimo burger. It was one of the best things we ate that week. A toasted pretzel bun, gooey cheese and moist hamburger meat. I actually liked it better than the Cheeseburger in Paradise (a few doors down) that I had later in the week. My boo and his sister got the fish tacos. They were very fresh and tasty.

Here's a tip for having a great meal and one of the best values in Maui (it's virtually impossible to find a nicer restaurant with a view that you don't expect to pay a lot for your meal):  1. Grab a free Hula pie coupon from one of the nearby retailers.  Usually if you look somewhat interested in what's in their store they will offer you a coupon if you mention you're going to Kimo's. 2. Order the ginormous 32 oz Prime Rib and split it among 2 to 3 persons. 3.  Get the free Hula dessert. It's so big it will feed 2-3 people. The end result?  For around $35 (minus drinks) you get a delicious meal for 2 to 3 people!",Ray P.,"Vancouver, Canada",4.0 star rating

Our waitress (don't remember her name) was friendly and effortlessly convinced us to try their famous hula pie.

2/18/2014,5.0 star rating,"Really great casual bar food located in the middle of downtown Lahaina and with a great outdoor patio on the water. The outdoor area is especially cool because all of the tables are covered by huge canvas umbrellas....that way you can be outdoors, on the water, and not get overheated by the Maui sun.

Great food (mahi mahi fish tacos, burgers, french fries, Hula Pie). Food is consistently good. They also have a decent happy hour (although we were never there during that time). Once you eat there, they give you a coupon for a free Hula Pie on your next visit (with the order of two entrees). Thought that was pretty cool.

Bartender, nicknamed Coach, provided us with great service. On the ball, quick, friendly, professional. We had a great time having lunch at the bar before heading back to CA.

A great spot to visit during your trip to Maui...especially if you are looking for a  fun, active spot, with gorgeous water views, and not too pricey (compared to some of the more high end spots in town who have $40 entrees).",Sara B.,"Santa Rosa, CA",4.0 star rating

For starters it's in downtown L'haina, which is sort of dumpy in my opinion. Don't be surprised to see some shady characters there, or guys standing in alleyways drinking out of brown paper bags. Didn't feel comfortable there at night.

The food was good, nothing outrageously good, but pretty good. The service was very good, our waitress was so cute, friendly, knowledgeable, and peppy, also on top of all our needs.

I went on Thanksgiving day and they had a full menu plus a Thanksgiving special, which the BF got. I thought the Thanksgiving food was perfectly acceptable, nothing special.

As with our previous experiences our dinner was excellent. We passed on appetizers as I was saving room for a Hula pie, a Kimo's specialty. I usually order one of the fish dishes but this time tried their Kushiyaki; it was very good and a nice change of pace. My wife ordered the Kalua pork lettuce wraps as her entrée and really liked them. Plus it left her room to join me in enjoying the Hula pie which was wonderful. Our server was excellent and all in all a great dinner. So a week later we were back.
The second visit was just as enjoyable as the first. I ordered the ono or wahoo which is a firm fish and was complimented by the parmesan crusted  preparation. We enjoyed a couple of tropical dinks (they make very good chi-chi's) so neither of us had room for the Hula pie this time. Once again the service was excellent and we had a great time.

Food was still good, nothing extraordinary, I've had much better food on the mainland, but it's a tourist place, so if you can find anything slightly above mediocre then you're lucky. 
With service on the other hand we weren't  that lucky.To be fair, our main server was really polite and attentive, but unfortunately she wasn't the only person we had to deal with. The server who brought our main dishes just dumped hot plates in front of our 9 month kid and rushed away. It's the first time I encountered anything like this. The other server who was supposed to bring our desert got distracted and just put the plate on the table without saying a word. All while talking to other guests with his back turned to us. 
Also, changing table is located in the ADA bathroom, behind the door with ""employees only"" sign. So unless you specifically ask for it there is no way to find it yourself.

2nd star - drink orders taken and promptly served before dinner.  I had my water glass refilled at least three times without even asking.

3rd star - the server asked us if we wanted the kids' meals to be served first.

4th star - server recommendation on the Monchong (Fresh Fish section) was excellent.  There are seven different ways to have the fish selections prepared.  I chose ""Parmesan Crusted"" and it was delicious.  All of the entrees come with a Caesar Salad, fresh hot bread and carrot muffins (hard to eat just one).

5th star - our server Sean was outstanding!  Great customer service skills!  He checked up on us every 5 - 10 minutes.

Bonus tip - one of the coupon books has one for this restaurant for a free ""Original Hula Pie"" with the purchase of two entrees (it's Kimo's version of a mud pie).  So, so good!  Can feed a family of four (or two really hungry adults).

Overall, the food wasn't stellar but wasn't awful either. I ordered a regular hamburger and it was OK.  I tried poke (pronounced po-kay) for the first time here and it's just like a ceviche.  We got the ahi tuna poke served with chips. The tuna was really fresh so I give them that.  If you choose outdoor seating on the deck, you literally face the water. But be warned that the waves can splash onto the deck. There were several times when the heavy tides were approaching and the water splashed onto the table. Thank goodness, it's the Hawaii ocean water and not the East River of NYC. Otherwise, I would have been more disgusted.",Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0 star rating
6/16/2014,2.0 star rating,"After visiting front street a few times and not being able to get a table at this spot the pass 2 times we were visiting maui we were super stoked to finally get a reservation and try kimo's. 

My husband called to make our reservation for a party of 4 @ 7PM around 12PM on the day of the res. We called the restaurant  @ 4 to re-confirm our reservations and the hostess said she didn't see a reservation but could make us one if we'd like, at that point it went down hill=( my husband re-made the reservation and asked her for a res id # for us to reference when we check in, she said she didn't have a res id # but to give our first and last name for the table when we arrive. 

When we arrived to the restaurant and checked in they said they weren't able to locate the res, after 5-8 minutes of ""researching"" she finally found the res and asked the host to get us seated. 

Upon getting seated we noticed lots of hustle and bustle going on, the weather was amazing, the view of the ocean, soft cool breeze and live music playing was amazing, that is why we are giving this review 2 stars. Simply for the fact that the setting is awesome. 

Our male waiter came to the table and introduced himself quickly, passed out menus, put water down and said he'd be right back. I didn't realize it would be 15+ minutes until the next time we were going to see him. Upon his returned he asked if we wanted to order an appetizer which we did, the ahi tower was ono and enjoyed by everyone at the table. We waited 12-15 minutes for our appetizer. When he returned again he asked if it was okay for him to explain the fish dishes to us which we agreed to, he then said he'd give us a little more time to think about what we were going to order. Never offered us soft drink beverages, never told us what they're specialty cocktails were. He was pretty cut and dry, never wore a smile or even engaged in any conversation with us which was unfortunate because he engaged with the table behind us and across us. 

We ordered dinner, my husband got the ribs, myself and 1 of our guests got the chicken and my daughter got a kid's cheeseburger. MY mistake was thinking that this place was going to chef up something amazing. I would've been better off stopping by costco for $5.99 rotisserie chicken, prepared ribs and a cheeseburger from mcdonald's =( we were very disappointed. The chicken was dry and under seasoned, the ribs looked like someone took a spoonful of sauce and slathered it on top before it went out to the table and the cheeseburger was so dry my daughter took one bite and pushed it on the side=( 

We were so looking forward to having hula pie since the rest of the dinner wasn't what we expected...... Unfortunately, our waiter didn't offer us dessert or make an  effort to tell us what the hula pie was. It was really disappointing.

3/4/2012,4.0 star rating,"One of our must-stops in Maui... it's usually straight here from the airport.  

We LOVE the HULA PIE!  (In fact, if you bring a receipt from a previous visit, you get a free slice... and I saved an almost-completely-faded receipt from 3 years ago in my wallet, awaiting our return trip.)  We dream of the Oreo crust filled with vanilla macadamia nut ice cream, drenched in fudge and more macadamia nuts.... yes, it's probably thousands of calories, but so worth it!  And now we have another saved receipt for a free slice next time!

Okay - I should mention the nutritious food too I suppose.  The complimentary bread is a passable pumpkin muffin and bread roll.  An above average caesar salad is included with every entree.  My husband gets the PRIME RIB every time - either the Molokini cut ($26.95) or the 32 oz bone-in ($35.95) when he's feeling ambitious.  This comes with au jous and horseradish sauces on the side and a fantastic buttery creamy mashed potatoes.  I usually opt for one of their fish preparations - they have many options of different fishes cooked to various preparations.  This visit, I had to MONCHONG BAKED KIMO'S STYLE ($31.95) with just garlic, basil, and lemon sauce.  Simple, but sublime - it really brought out the juicy tender flakiness of the fish.  

Excellent service every time with friendly waitresses.  They do have a weird ""drinks team"" -- many girls (too many) to take your drink orders.  We must've gotten asked 4 times after we'd already placed an order.  A tolerable quirk, I suppose.  Have to get those Mai Tai's somehow!

Great view of the boats with Lana'i as the perfect sunset backdrop.  Live music on most nights.  We're not big fans of Lahaina (too crowded, too touristy, Florida-esque, not pure Hawai'i enough...), but we bear Lahaina to come to Kimo's.  

Make reservations or you will no doubt have to wait an hour at least!!",Heather s.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

The service was lackadaisical and without energy, very scripted. Food was very fast out of the kitchen obviously pre portioned and set up for speed of turning tables as quickly as possible.

If you are looking for fresh fish prepared amazingly well there are better options, but if you want good drinks and some Apps while hanging out on the water. This is the spot.",Robert W.,"Napa, CA",4.0 star rating
2/7/2014,5.0 star rating,"My husband and I came to Maui for our honeymoon and made absolutely sure Kimo's was one of the spots we would hit up! After our whale watch we got to the front door right as dinner service started. We had a lovely server named Amy and she was very informative!

Husband had Seafood Ciopinni and I had Parmesan crusted Ono with basmati rice pilaf and some vegetables. Everything was cooked to perfection and FRESH! Sooooo good! I had never had Ono before and it was delicious. His scallops were amazing and buttery and the broth had a nice kick to it!

I also had a Mai tai, because when in Rome right? It was great, very strong but very drinkable!

Since we are staying at a resort nearby we received a free hula pie! I had been to maui before, even dukes in Malibu, so I have ha Hula pie a few times :) HUSBAND on the other hand had never had it! He loved it!

Had dinner here on a Friday night around 8:30pm.  Right on Front street and was seated in a cozy corner on the patio.  They had live music going on that night which was nice.

Service-
Made reservations and still had to wait 15 minutes.  Took a while for service to come around and even longer before they came again to place the order.

Food- 
Prices are high and for the quality and quantity we got  we didn't think it was worth it.

Since we were seated on the side by some plants, we did encounter a couple of different bugs which wasn't too appetizing when you're eating.  I know its a tropical place in an outdoor area but just FYI!

5/30/2014,4.0 star rating,"Solid restaurant located in the lively section of Front St.

(1) Great views of the ocean from the upstairs section.  Just a reminder, ocean view is probably not critical once the sun sets because you really cannot see anything.  Yes it is common sense, but vacation high clouded my thinking.

(2) My wife and I received friendly and attentive service from our waiter, Jim.  He even was able to recommend a safe fish dish for my pregnant wife.

(3) Amazing mahi mahi dish.  The fish was juicy and the portion was ample.  However, the mac nut calamari was a complete miss, as it was overly fried.

(4) Nice energy in the restaurant.  It was noisy, but not college bar noisy.  The live music was excellent and an added treat.

(5) The price point is about right.  There are definitely more expensive options on the island.

Overall, Kimo's is an excellent value for a fun, beach front dining experience.",Brian B.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

Wedge salad could have fit in the palm of a baby's hand!  Wanted to have dinner but bolted after experiencing and seeing the aforementioned.

Food is good, standard.

The food was good, but it's hard to stay positive with having to look for staff to help you. We were talking and enjoying the night when a rat, no kidding, came skittering across the dining area floor. He hid under tables and we again tried to get the attention of anyone on the staff. Finally had to go and get the manager, who told us 'that's what happens when you are located in harbor'. Really?

-Lava Flow - I had a lava flow the night before elsewhere that was amazing so tried one here and it was just ok. The flavor was off and not the creamy dreamy drink I was anticipating. 

Overall, this was a decent dinner and reasonably priced considering a lot of other options but the food is hit or miss. They also charged us for avocado on the tacos, and the service was ok, not great. 

I am sure there are other better options on Front Street but you'll be fed and happy enough with the hula pie if you stop in here.",Hillary M.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating
4/11/2014,2.0 star rating,"Really disappointing.

We came here based both on general reviews and the recommendation of a friend. Our waitress was extraordinarily slow delivering the first round of drinks, but I was prepared to let that slide as it was busy.

We ordered the three appetizers our waitress recommended: the poke tower, smoked fish bruschetta, and the calamari. When the first two arrived, I thought to myself, ""these are small."" Then we began to eat them. The poke was really unimpressive. The bruschetta was okay--the best thing we had. The calamari arrived next, and when someone tasted and said, ""this is bad, is this a sign we shouldn't keep eating here,"" we realized she was right. I almost never leave restaurants. And we had six people--leaving takes a big momentum shift. 

We left without ordering entrees. The appetizers were TGI Fridays quality at best--and smaller than you would receive there. There is plenty of good food to be had on the island, go elsewhere.",Ian C.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating
12/28/2011,4.0 star rating,"We came here for dinner after an afternoon walking around Lahaina.  We wanted some place that had good quality food, a nice view, and a reasonable price, which can be tough to find in Lahaina, but Yelp led us here and we weren't disappointed.    Contrary to what Maui Revealed says, you can sit on the lower level for dinner.  We had a reservation for 5:30 pm and when we arrived around 5:15 we were led to a reserved table right on the water.   The view was stunning and we got to enjoy the sunset as well.

All the entrees come with their Caesar salads, which are huge and really good, one of the best I've ever had.  The bread basket is also very big and comes with a white roll and a carrot muffin for each person.   For our entrees, my mom & I shared a mac nut mahi mahi stuffed with lobster and a parmesean crusted mahi mahi (do you detect a theme for our entrees on Maui?).   My fiance had teriyaki sirloin and my dad had koloa pork & polynesian chicken.    All agreed that the food was quite good.  I especially liked the parm crusted mahi mahi which came with a nice cream sauce.   The lobster stuffed mahi mahi was alright, but inevitably drew comparisons to the one at Mama's Fish House, which was far superior (but then again, this one was half the price of Mama's).   

The tourist offices in Lahaina have coupons for a free signature dessert, hula pie.  It has an a chocolate crumb crust, a huge amount of ice cream, and is topped with chocolate sauce and macadamia nuts.   It was pretty good, but could have used a higher chocolate:ice cream ratio.   It was enormous, however, and we couldn't finish it between 4 of us.   

This place is certainly not cheap, but it is fairly reasonable for Maui and considering the location right on the water.    The non-fish entrees are in the low $20s and the fish is around $30.   We all had leftovers to take home for a lunch the next day.   The quality of the food is solid, if not mind-blowing.  Service was friendly & the waterfront location is beautiful, especially if you can get a table right on the edge.   Overall, I would recommend for a nice, (slightly) more budget friendly meal.",A M.,"West Lafayette, IN",4.0 star rating

9/23/2011,3.0 star rating,"It was really nice of our waiter to make me a cheeseburger for dinner even though it's not offered on the menu.  Unfortunately, the cheeseburger was just okay.  

Both the men in our party ordered the prime rib, one big and one small.  The 32 oz., bone-in prime rib tasted better but is literally big enough to feed 2-3 hungry people.  

We had coupons for two free hula pies and even free, I wouldn't get this again.  It's just like a Claim Jumper dessert.  Overly big, overly sweet, overly syrup-ed.  Beneath the chocolate drizzle, I could kind of taste the mac nut ice cream but it's so big that it melts fast and I couldn't break through the crust.

If you're looking to watch the sunset during dinner, the patio area would be perfect but make a reservation just in case.  It could be busy as this is a total tourist joint.",Shannon L.,"East Bay, CA",4.0 star rating

Food was just okay. I had the Teriyaki Sirloin. Half of it was good, the other half was a chewy, inedible mass of connective tissue. Not sure if the chowder was fresh or if was premade from a distributor like Sysco. Sure tasted like it was premade, just like soups at other chain restaurants. Everything was adequate and okay, just like a chain restaurant. The entire dining experience felt scripted, just like a chain restaurant.

It was pricey and definitely tasted like any other restaurants by the pier. Nothing was significantly special. Nothing really ""Hawaiian"" except that it was right by the waters.

The fish was the size of a regular steak, and about 1 1/2"" thick cut!! The prime rib was took up half the plate, and again 2"" thick cut!!  This meal we took home with us at the end of the night. It was good, just wished there was more sauce on both the steak and the fish. 

The best parts were the carrot muffins and the kona pie. Those muffins were sooo good, like mini carrot cakes. The kona pie.... Macadamia ice cream, Oreo crust, hot fudge.... Nuff said.

I ordered the 32 oz. prime rib, it was okay, not amazing like I would have expected for close to $60. Portion wise it was accurately sized though and you're actually getting close to 32 oz. of steak which is alot of meat. The sides it came with were forgettable and in fact I don't even remember what they were. I ordered some Coconut Shrimp as an extra side dish for $10, when I got it, there were only 3 pieces of shrimp on there. The shrimp wasn't very flavorful it just tasted like breaded shrimp that was deep fried, no hint of coconut. The mixed drinks tasted good but were pretty small, watered down and very pricey, like $12-14 each. It was kind of expected t hough this area is a tourist trap.

We came with a fairly large party, they put us on the second floor facing Front Street which is a pretty crappy view because you can't see anything other than some store fronts. It had very poor ventilation and with the fans going it was still very hot, even at 8PM. Service was also very slow which was probably attributed to our table being located on the second floor tucked away in a corner. Food delivery was pretty spaced out in a bad way, some people got their food 20 minutes after they ordered while others were waiting almost an hour.

The drinks were a bit on the sweet side.  And if you come here for lunch, be prepared to sit in the sun for part of your meal.

Food was amaze. I was there with a table 5, and well ordered different plates.
I went with the Ono, which was OH YES! so so so good. My other dinner dates ordered ribs, filet mignon, swordfish with coconut crusted.

I had the mahi mahi that was lobster topped! #amazing haha. It also comes with a rice pilaf that was perfectly cooked. I believe the lobster topped option comes baked while the Parmesan crusted option with the mahi, which was what my wife had comes pan fried. It came out a tad dry but was still good. Can't beat the setting and the food. Last but not least ordered the Hula pie, but wait, the specialty pumpkin spice hula pie which was out of this world!!

5/17/2011,3.0 star rating,"Awesome atmosphere for enjoying the setting Maui sun.  The food, however, is not amazing despite very fresh ingredients...a bit surprising actually. Not sure why it's 2 dollar signs -- because dinner is definitely more like 3 ($30 entrees)

I still would recommend Kimo's for anyone seeking a romantic evening in Lahainna.  However, I'd probably tell them to forget dinner and walk right up for drinks/appetizers on the lower deck.  The Lower deck is dedicated for non-dinner guests so their is no wait.   The view is better and you'll be next to the live band.  They still serve a limited (and more affortable) food menu including the essentials like their hula pie.  Kimo's drinks in general are surprising cheap and delishly fresh.  Happy hour (3pm-5pm) has ridic cheap prices too ($3-6).  Try the Mai Thai or any of their blended treats.

It being my first time, I didnt know better and did the full dinner.  We wait about 40 min at the deck and moved upstairs for our table.  Hostess and servers were all very nice took a full 5 minutes to rattle off the specials and menu.  We opted out of the various fish entrees and ordered:

--Prime Rib ($27 for Molokini cut) -- their larger cut ($36) is 32OZ -- who does that?!  This smaller one is still 14oz and quite the monster (see my pic)!  More than enough to share.  Meat was very tender and great texture.  They trimmed the edges which, unfortunately, happens to be the fattiest, tastitest, and my favorite part.  Without it, it was just bite after bite of pink meat...so it gets kind of bleh after a while. Mash potatoes side was heaven.

--Cioppino ($26) A full fillet of fresh fish and plenty of shrimp (see pic).  A few mussels and calms.  All the ingredients were ocean fresh -- only probably is they dont know how to make a good cioppino sauce.  It tasted too simple of a tomatoe sauce w/ no italian kick. 

--Hula Pie ($7) best thing about Kimo's!! It's basically a crunchy oreo crusted pie, filled with creamy vanilla ice gream with macademian nuts mixed in, and topped with whipped cream and chilled chocolate sauce.  Times 10.  YUM.

All in all, the food is very bland and Americanized -- no real seasoning or marination.  But oh, their carrot cake bread and warm rolls are great.  One last tip -- printed at the bottom of receipts is a coupon for a free hula pie on your next visit, so you can come back another day if you're too full for dessert!!",Kendra W.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
2/29/2012,5.0 star rating,"Best seafood place we've had while we were in Hawaii! My boyfriend and I were walking down Front Street looking for souvenirs for friends and family back home. We had stopped to look at the menu, but contiued to walk the street and look at other restaurants' menus before deciding where to eat. We ended up eating somewhere else that night, but decided to come back and have lunch here the next day.

Sat in the patio area which over looked the ocean. Ah... so beautiful. It was a little cloudy because it had rained the night before, but still beautiful. I ordered the Fresh Island Fish which was their fresh fish of the day (Mahi Mahi) with macaroni salad and rice. My boyfriend got the Beer Battered Fish 'n Chips that came with fries. The Mahi Mahi was amazing! Citrus marinated, succulent, and cooked perfectly. The Fish 'n Chips were really great too. Fried to a crispy golden brown. The batter was light and the fish is flaky and very generous. At one point, the waves were crashing up against the restaurant pretty hard. So hard, a small crab got washed up on the patio and some ocean water landed in our food. The waiter was so nice and accommodating that he took our food back and got us a fresh plate even though we had eaten some of it already.

After eating and paying for our food, the receipt offers a complimentary Kimo's Pie on your next visit. As much as I want to go back and order the same thing, plus get a free dessert on the house, who knows when the next time I'm going to be able to go back to Hawaii.

We started with the poke.  Their's is a delicious version served with lots of avocado.   My husband had the ribs and coconut shrimp; I had the baked Kimo style white fish.  Both were good, not fantastic.  My ""vegetables"" were two spears of asparagus sautéed to within an inch of their lives and a half a tomato with some shards of cheese.

My daughter once again caused us to exit early with her usual nervous breakdown right after pupas.  Rather then turn the hose on her, we ran from the building per our usual.

I ordered the Stuffed Lobster Tail on a Mahi Mahi with Cesar Salad. This was pretty delish but I specified to my sweet waitress that I couldn't eat cucumber. So I requested that it get taken out of all salads. I specified I am not allergic but it'll make me barf. She said, ""Okay, no problem."" 

My meal comes and I'm ready to jump on my dish.  It  looks delicious accompanied with basmati rice alongside a cucumber infused veggie mix.

I've NEVER sent back a meal in my whole life. But this one I had to. I just couldn't eat majority of my meal because the raw-er cucumber prepared side dish touched everytihing. So I had to eat the scraps of my boyfriends very scrumptious baby back ribs while I waited for ""my replacement meal"".  

The waitress was the sweetest and kindest waitress in the whole world. She helped me switch my meal to another full rack of baby back ribs. If there was an award for best accommodating waitress I'd nominate her. I am grateful that she was as kind hearted as she was.

3/27/2011,4.0 star rating,"Wow. 304 yelp reviews and a 34-year old institution. What's left to say? 

I suppose my most useful comments at this point will be decorum related. 
First off, make a reservation. I know, I know. It's vacation. But remember: that's what everyone else is thinking too. You want a reservation, and you want it for sunset, and you want to sit upstairs on the deck. Trust me, you do. 

Next, order a bottle. Provided that you drink the vino, that is. Kimo's has a pretty good selection of PNW favorites (both Benton Lane and King Estate are on the list), apparently someone high up in the chain has an Oregon connection. Props.

Order a couple of apps, and a separate salad. Don't do the complementary Caesar. It's not worth it. 

Share an entree. 

Ask your server for some breaks between courses AND TIP ACCORDINGLY (the table next to hubs and me turned over three times while we were sitting there. Do the math). 
The waitstaff have been trained well here, and will get you in and out as quick as possible. This practice can be good in some cases, but not if you're going here for the sunset view.

Kimo's Restaurant is a waterfront establishment, so we had a nice view as we ate our dinner.  It was typical seafood fare, and I had a bite of each dish we ordered.  My favorite was the coconut crusted ahu.  It was cooked perfectly, and suprisingly filling.  We ended our meal with a hula pie, which is a GIGANTIC slice of macnut ice cream, in between two large cookies, covered in whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate syrup. Talk about rich!

I had a citrus herbed Mahi Mahi and it was good - my Mom's entree, a parmesan crusted Opa, was not to her liking.  The appetizers - coconut shrimp and kahlua pork lettuce wraps - were really solid, though.  Service was kind of aloof, but I don't blame them with all the tourists they must have to deal with on a daily basis.  The vibe/atmosphere was ok because it wasn't packed when we were there, which was later than normal dinner time for the islands, but I don't think I'd like it if it were packed.

10/30/2014,3.0 star rating,"I'm going to have to agree with the ""tourist trap"" contingency on this one... Had dinner at Kimo's on hubs' birthday and found it to be fairly mediocre. Nothing terrible, just nothing spectacular (except the sunset...). ;)

Food - We started with the Fire Roasted Vegetable Goat Cheese Dip... it was fine... Hubs had the Kimo's Style (I think it was pink snapper that night) and I had the Parmesan Crusted (Monchong that evening). Hubs' dish was cooked well, although somehow a bit bland while still feeling heavy... Mine was overcooked big time... Ended with the Hula Pie on the house due to the birthday (which was super sweet - the loud birthday song singing was less sweet, but I digress). Hula Pie. That thing is ridiculous. You should do it just once... just because... All that plus one glass of wine totaled just over $100 after tax/tip... 

Service/Atmosphere - We sat upstairs (made a reservation), and it was quite the gorgeous view (well... from some places. We were seated on a weird corner so the view was a bit obstructed but still pretty fantastic). Sunset here is truly amazing... Service was good - friendly, knowledgeable, no complaints.

In conclusion - honestly, the food just doesn't live up to the prices in my mind. It feels like you're paying for the sunset view (which is admittedly priceless). I'd say go downstairs for a drink or two and a sunset... but skip the dining upstairs...",Permahungry C.,"Denver, CO",4.0 star rating

7/14/2011,4.0 star rating,"Front Street is lined with tourist trap type restaurants, but this is one of the better. While the food is just alright, the view and drinks are reason enough to make this stop. I like having a mid day drink and appetizers here, or starting the night with drinks here. The ocean view, cool breeze, and crashing sound of the waves are all idyllic at any time of the day. 

I suggesting attempting to sit 'on the rail' which is closest to the water. This will afford you a great view, although there really are no bad views. CAUTION: sitting close to the rail can result in getting splashed by crashing waves. 

The service can sometimes be slow, which is a direct result of the popularity of this place. I've always found the servers and front desk to be extremely nice, likely a prerequisite. 

For lunch I had the fish taco, which is jumbo in size, but lacked great flavor. My wife enjoyed the smoked marlin which she said was very good and came with a nice garnish setup on the side. My young girls each enjoyed fries and a Berger, they have all the common kid fare. 

As it relates to drinks, go for the lava flow which is tasty, otherwise they have several local beers on draft. If those don't sound like they will quench your thirst, they have a full bar.  Did I mention the view?",Chris G.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",4.0 star rating

4/20/2011,4.0 star rating,"oh, kimo's, thinking about you makes my mouth water...we dined here one night on recommendation by our friends who joined us on this trip. so glad we did! I really wanted to eat nothing but fresh fish all week and this place lived up to its reputation. sure, it has a duke's-vibe to it but I think the kids all appreciated the live island music playing and outdoor dining with a view of the ocean. its casual, almost picnic style seating is perfect for families (i.e., spills/messes). (note: don't sit near the back corner of the upper deck, where we would have originally sat, since it was stuffy and a bit musty-smelling there for me).

i ordered the monchong prepared kimo's style with a garlic, lemon, and sweet basil sauce. i was worried that it would be too sweet but i think they meant naturally sweet basil, because my entree came out perfect and the marinade (think pesto) was just devine. i never had monchong before but it was true to description: light, flaky and moist. it reminds me of cross between a trout and talipia but lighter? regardless, delish, so much that i finished my dish before realizing that i forgot to take a photo!

the hubs ordered the monchong parmesan crusted with panko crumbs. at first, i was skeptical as i have always found that parmesan crust overwhelms the fish. not so here. it was a light crust that allowed the fish to shine! his fish was so good, i kept wanting to reach over for more, but had to restrain myself. he's probably going to ask me to prepare that herbed beurre blanc with capers back home for our fish dinners! 

the entrees were on the steeper side for a casual restaurant at $32 but for deliciously prepared fresh fish, i thought it was worth it! service was pleasant but somewhat off as our server kept forgetting a few items.  however, i don't blame her but more the scheduler since the place was packed and i felt they could use more servers rather than bussers/hostesses of which there were plenty.

the bottle of chardonnay (la crema?) that we ordered was light, but somewhat ordinary. the famous hula pie was tasty but since i'm not always a huge fan of desserts (unless it's a chocolate souffle), some in our group might have appreciated this dish more than me.

From the bar we enjoyed the Lahaina Lemonade & a Mai Tai - both were smooth and tasty.
Ordered the Iceburg & Gorgonzola salad (featured a wedge of iceburg lettuce w/gorgonzola cheese, asian pears, avocado, candied walnuts & tomatos) and the calamari (lightly breaded, not greasy and large pieces) and both were good.
For entrees we had steak, one had the coconut crusted marlin w/pineapple salsa & peanut sauce, two others had the monchong prepared with citrus sauce. All were good portions of seafood, accompanied with green beans or asparagus and rice.

3/2/2012,4.0 star rating,"Great Food, Great View! 

Reading some of these reviews made me think this place might be hit or miss.  If that's the case, I definitely hit!  I've seen some reviews about the view not being great.  These people are wrong.  Don't take my word for it, I've attached a picture of the view about 45 minutes before sunset.  It's spectacular, and you'll get it no matter where you sit.  I walked around to verify that.  Okay, now for the Review.

Food: Ohhh, so good! I had the coconut crusted fish (at the hostess' recommendation). My parents both had the lobster-stuffed Mahi.  They were both delicious...like seriously good.  The coconut crusted preparation came with a spicy thai peanut sauce that played nicely with the coconut flaked crust, accompanying this dish was a pineapple salsa.  They must have known how much I love sweet and spicy because this was incredible to me.  I can't say much for the lobster Mahi Mahi dish, because I had a bite out of courtesy when my mom asked me if I wanted to try hers.  The little piece I did take tasted pretty good.  We had the Famous Hula pie.  At first I was thinking that it was okay, then I looked down and the pie was gone...so I guess that means it's pretty good.  

Service: Great service.  We had Shawn (or possibly Sean...you can never tell with that name : )   He was really attentive and competent with the menu selection.  Other than Sean, we were served by the numerous other wait staffers who never let our drinks go empty or our empty plates sit for too long.  On a hopefully not to inappropriate note, the waitresses were all incredibly beautiful to me, and really friendly.  

Ambiance: I think I've covered this already, but it's a great place to have dinner and watch the sunset.  

Here's a tip I discovered:  They fill 1/3 of the restaurant with reservations.  The other 2/3 is set up for walk-in.  If you show up at 5, or slightly before, you'll get a great seat, that gives you a great vantage point for the sunset.

We were able to walk in, no wait, back on12/16, and found the restaurant packed! Decked out for Christmas, very festive, and live music bellowing, or is it billowing?... out from the level below us. Anywho, you know what I mean :)  We were seated on the 2nd floor, overlooking the water, and while it was dark, the lapping water, mild temperature, amazing food, and enjoying the holidays in 80 degree weather, it was really hard to find fault with this place. Our group of 6 had only one disappointment: they were all out of AHI... the only fish it seemed that our table wanted... I honestly can't remember what I'd ordered, but it was a pleasant substitute, and it was panko crusted.  All that remains in my memory now, aside from a few photos to share, is that heavenly creation, the hula pie! We six INHALED this thing within seconds it seemed.  Our server, James, I believe it was, served the hula pie complimentary for the inconvenience of the ahi incident.  All-in-all, one of the better, more flavorful dining experiences for me in Maui.

It's because of your scrumptious house-made caesar salad that I learned to enjoy fresh greens as a kid. Your fish offerings are, without fail, flavorful and cooked to perfection. Those carrot muffins and the whipped butter--talk about bliss. And the Hula Pie: decadence. However, you've lost your edge. What's with the changes you've made? Charging for the salad? I suppose it's just because you don't much care to distinguish yourself from the other fine dining options in Lahaina. I mean, the views in the afternoon and sunset from your seaside location will always draw people who wish to grace your patio and upper deck in for dinner. Perhaps you guessed that was good enough.

7/10/2011,4.0 star rating,"My husband and I stopped here for lunch at the beginning of our drive from Ka'anapali to the Haleakala crater and loved it!

Kimo's is the perfect spot for lunch. We got a great table overlooking the ocean (most of their tables do). The menus are already waiting for you at the table; this place is super casual. We ordered the smoked marlin as an appetizer. 

Wow! What a pleasant surprise that marlin was. The fish was fresh and came with thinly sliced Maui onions, capers, and a horseradish cream that wasn't too intense, just right. My husband tried using a thin piece of fish as a ""roll"" with the capers and onions in it and it was a fantastic idea. Marlin appetizer = gem.

I ordered the Fresh Island Fish and yes, it was fresh and delicious. It came with rice and macaroni salad. The macaroni salad would have been better if it were colder, but that's my only complaint.

My husband got the coconut crusted island fish, which was also good but quite different from what I ordered (sweeter and heavier).

The lady made an honest mistake, but after that most of the service continued to be spotty.  Our server gave an excellent description of the fresh fish preparations, but wasn't very attentive after that.  The meal was delish, our mixed drinks were pretty weak.

The smoked fish bruschetta has a great kick with the horseradish, perfect for sharing a light appetizer.  The carrot muffins, rolls and fresh butter are absolutely delicious.

Our waiter had a selection of fresh caught fish to choose from.  We enjoyed the snapper, Ono and monchong.  Generous portions, loved the veggies and rice pilaf which were also served on the plate.  The fish was fresh, but some in our party found the preparation of the Ono a bit bland.

3/18/2013,4.0 star rating,"I'm only putting 4 stars because I can't give a half of a star, really I'm only taking off half of star for some minor issues.

As I got to pick Coconuts Fish Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/coconuts-fish-cafe-kihei#hrid:i4znXts29yTy4qDSMFbeLQ) for lunch in Kihei yesterday, my sister got to pick today's lunch in Lahaina. She looked in our Fromer's guidebook and liked the sound of this place, so I doubled checked the ""street cred"" on Yelp! to find that it would be a good place for us to eat lunch. So off we drove from Makena Landing to Lahaina.

We waited about a minute before a hostess came up to seat us and she immediately said sorry for the wait. I know that must be a standard line for them but hey, I will accept politeness! 

Our waitress was great, her name escapes me but she was quick to respond when we asked which fish dish she preferred: the Coconut Crusted Island Fish (Peanut sauce, pineapple salsa, white rice, macaroni salad) or Fresh Island Fish (Roasted in sweet basil lemon & garlic glaze and served with white rice and macaroni salad or sandwich style with fries). She said that she personally preferred the Fresh Island Fish because she doesn't like peanut sauce or spicy food that much. While we thought about our food options (which were many and all sounded amazing), we ordered the Macadamia Nut Crusted Calamari (Breaded calamari served with house made cocktail sauce).

My mom and sister wound up ordering the Coconut Crusted Island Fish (they both love peanut sauce and Thai food) and my dad chose the Fresh Island Fish. I went for the  Paniolo Burger (Applewood smoked bacon, grilled onions, BBQ sauce, shredded lettuce, tomatoes) with french fries. The other dishes sounded great but we have salmon at our cottage to eat for dinner tonight. It took about 20 minutes for our food to arrive and I dove into my burger with gusto. While the ingredients were not ""gourmet"", the final result was definitely pleasing. I sampled a small bite of the Fresh Island Fish and found that to be great as well.

I made sure to save room for Hula Pie (we saw some when we came in and it looked AMAZING). They offered us traditional (macademia nut ice cream center) or March's seasonal flavor (mint chocolate chip), we ordered the traditional. Holy moly that's some good stuff! Definitely worth the drive up from Makena. Imagine this Yelpers, Oreo cookie crust, RICH macademia nut ice cream, thick gooey fudge, whipped cream and macademia nuts sprinkled on top.

Now for the reasons I knocked off 1/2 of a star:
- my dad's piece of fish in the Fresh Island Fish was quite small, slightly larger than half of what I expected it would have been. Thank goodness I didn't finish my burger or he would have been hungry!
-they charged us $1.50 (without telling us) to change the sides on my mom's side of macaroni salad to Caesar salad and my dad's sides to all salad with bleu cheese dressing.
- the lemonades were $3.50 and totally NOT worth it, I like my lemonade tart but this wasn't just tart, it was slightly off somehow (not sure what happened)",Laura D.,"Pasadena, CA",4.0 star rating

3/25/2015,4.0 star rating,"We drove up to Lahaina from Kihei to see the sights and have some lunch. After finding parking (nosmall feat) we took a walk up and down Front St. looking for a place to eat. I remembered Kimo's from the ""Maui Revealed"" guide book so we
passed on Bubba Gump's, Cheeseburger in Paradise (crazy crowded ... was
Jimmy Buffet playing in there or what?), Lahaina Fish Grill, and Koa's. Kimo's
turned out to be a great choice.

While we waited for our table we got a round of drinks from the bar. I had a
lemonade based vodka drink I forget the name of, which was tasty. We got a
table quicker than anticipated and followed the hostess to our table. Really
great views from the dining area at Kimo's. We were seated right next to the
water and the entire restaurant would audibly ""whoa"" as two whales could be
seen in the ocean breaching and diving and doing all those cool momma and
baby whale things.

The food also didn't disappoint. I had the Wedge Salad with Steak. It was
great. Med rare and tender with a nice sear. It paired wonderfully with the
wedge salad's blue cheese dressing, bacon, and candied walnuts. The others in the
party ordered Ono fish sandwiches and a Shrimp Salad with Beets. All the
food was good to outstanding with my Wedge salad and the Shrimp Salad
being the best.

Service was outstanding, drinks were strong, food was really good, and the
view was great. My only regret is we didn't get to go back for another meal.
The Hula Pie seemed to be a favorite of some other diners near us, they raved
about it and told us to keep our receipt so we could get a free one next time
we go. I hope there is a next time!",J. P.,"Long Beach, CA",4.0 star rating
4/14/2013,2.0 star rating,"What a disappointment. I go to Maui at least once a year and tried almost every restaurant at least once. Kimo's is owned by TS Restaurants - the same owners as Duke's beach house, Leilani's and Hula Grill all on on Ka'anapali beach. All these restaurants operate at the same price point and even share many menu items. Given that I really enjoy all those restaurants, I was shocked by my terrible experience at Kimo's. 

First complaint - a 45 minute wait for lunch. Since it's located on front street, the tourists flock here. It's just not worth the wait. 

Second complaint - The restaurant looks dated - old dark woods and dark if your not seated on the deck. The tables on the deck have a good view of the ocean but most of the seating comes without the view. The three previously mentioned restaurants are all located right on the beach. Why pay the same price without the beautiful view?

Third complaint - We had to wait at least 10 - 15 minutes for a server to take our drink order. This is just not the case at other Maui restaurants. 

Fourth complaint - We ordered the same drinks we get at Dukes - The Lava flow and a Bikini Blonde on draft. The lava flow was just not as rich or thick and my beer tasted watered down.  

Final complaint - the food was simply not good.  I had the fresh fish plate - the Mahi Mahi. The fish portion was ridiculously small and completely over cooked / dry. It was served with a scoop of dull macaroni salad loaded with mayonnaise (yuck) and a side of plain flavourless white rice.  This was easily one of the worst meals I ever ate in Maui.  My wife had the Ahi fish tacos. You get two tacos with fresh Ahi (which was good) but it had way too much sauce - it ruined the dish. It was served with a side of oily nacho chips.

I don't get all the good reviews for Kimo's. I would have probably given Kimo's an extra star or two had I not been to so many similar priced restaurants in Maui that offer so much more. Trust me, try restaurants outside the Lahaina / Front street area.

I don't recommend this as the yelp picture I saw shows a huge piece but when I got my plate it looked like a tiny filet mignon. Not to mention I asked for Medium and got Med-Rare. Yuck! Made me sick! Tried to stomach it during the meal but the waitress came by and insisted they cook it again. They were at least nice enough to replenish my already finished rice side on the plate with a new scoop of rice. Points for that. We were celebrating my moms birthday so they threw in a half size hula pie also a nice touch. Bathrooms only have 2 stalls which is ridiculous for a 2 story restaurant. That needs improvement.

9/6/2014,5.0 star rating,Great atmosphere to enjoy an incredible meal at. My husband and I shared the kimo style mahi mahi and absolutely loved it! It melted in your mouth it was cooked so perfectly. The rice paired with it is out of this world good. A nice treat was the carrot cake type muffin they serve before dinner. It was like a pre dessert. We also enjoyed the macadamian nut crusted calamari that was delicious. The tarter sauce had a kick to it so don't pile too much on before you try it.,Danielle G.,"Temecula, CA",4.0 star rating
10/6/2014,1.0 star rating,"Absolutely agree with Joe E. 

We stopped by on 10-1-14 and had the same experience. It has been a few years since we have visited Kimo's and we were looking forward to a table on the rail. It has been a 20+ year tradition to kick off our Maui stay with lunch before checking in to our hotel. 
This last visit was really bad. The fish and chips were very disappointing and the presentation was mediocre. The serving sizes aren't what they used to be and the meal had a pre-fab previously frozen look to it. The sashimi was flat out horrible. 
This place isn't what it used to be and their reign has come to an end.  It takes more than a view these days.  Sadly, we probably won't be back.",Janice G.,"Eagle, ID",4.0 star rating

11/4/2010,4.0 star rating,"GREAT lunch with a great view!  So glad we stopped into Kimo's. After ""meh"" food experiences our first day in Maui, we headed over to Lahaina to explore and walked into this place to enjoy lunch on the ocean.

Our server was great and had no problem moving us to a table out of the direct sun when we asked. My Cobb salad, as boring as that sounds (who goes to Hawaii and orders a Cobb salad???), was DELICIOUS! I have to try Cobb salad whenever I see it on a menu and I seriously think this takes the award for best ever. They give you a big ass hunk of blue cheese, lots of avocado, and flavorful chicken.

My roomie got the Plate Lunch which had ribs, chicken teriyaki, and the standard mac salad and rice. The chicken teriyaki at Kimo's is white breast meat, YEAH! I really cannot understand the love for fatty, dark meat, pork-looking chicken teriyaki served at places like Da kitchen and Aloha Mixed Plate. I like my chicken white and juicy, not translucent and oily.

Of course we had to have the famous finale - Hula Pie. It was a good dessert to share. It's about 90% ice cream though so you have to be in the mood for that.

All in all we love our lunch at Kimo's and next time we are round Lahaina way, I will get that Cobb salad :)",Alison B.,"Phoenix, AZ",4.0 star rating

9/23/2012,5.0 star rating,"Came to Kimo's last year to share a Hula Pie with the hunny. We sat on the edge of the restaurant's deck close to the water. It was beautiful and the ambiance romantic. The Hula Pie was phenomenal so this year we were excited to come back for dinner. We made reservations ahead of time after checking the sunset times. It couldn't have worked out better! We walked in and they seated us immediately.  We noticed a few people waiting for a table.  We did notice about 10-15 minutes after we were seated- there were tons of people waiting for a table.  We had a table again right by the water and got to watch the sun go down behind Lanai. Gorgeous.  

The hubby ordered prime rib (we've had better) and I ordered the rosemary chicken  (amazing) and of course ended the night with the Hula Pie. :)

4/17/2013,3.0 star rating,"I thought this place was just ok when I went for lunch. Nothing on the menu jumped out and sounded amazing. But the restaurant is right on the water, so very pretty scenery.

I had the fresh fish plate and an order of the parmesan crusted calamari. The fish was fresh and delicious... it was slightly under seasoned, but that's how I like it! I can always add 2 shakes of salt. No biggy. Their light basil marinade over it was flavorful, that's what's important. However, the portion is quite small. The calamari was pretty meh though. I think it was overcooked. The batter coating was pretty dry and dark, indicating they over-fried it. Definitely nothing special... in fact, it tasted like frozen food. I didn't taste any parmesan or anything special about that batter. And we had the Hula pie for dessert per everyone's recommendation. It was very good, just be sure you aren't lactose intolerant. It's essentially an ice cream pie. YUM! 

I think their dinner menu looks much better than the lunch menu. But I really was so underwhelmed by my lunch here that I have no desire to return for dinner.",Victoria H.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating

The carrot cake with butter is super fresh and got the ahi/avocado poke as an appetizer. The poke needed a little more citrus and salt, but the quality of the ahi was very good. The blacken fish was cooked perfectly and buttery. The Thai flavor Mahi Mahi had a flavorful peanut sauce. The rice pilaf for both dishes was a good complement. The Hula Pie is a full of macadamia nuts, chocolate sauce and ice cream.",Sam L.,"Franklin, TN",4.0 star rating
8/27/2012,5.0 star rating,"Outstanding! After having too many disappointing food experiences in Lahaina, we picked up a guide book of Maui and started trying the restaurants they listed. Kimo's was one, and we are so glad we came here. So glad in fact we came back the very next night for our last meal in Maui. 

I had the filet the first night and it was delicious. I am kind of a steak snob, so I was a little apprehensive at first, but it came out cooked to perfection. Medium rare, just how I like it. My friend had some sort of fish cooked in an orange ginger glaze I think? I'm not too sure but she was wowed by it. The second night she had her fish cooked in the parmesan crust selection. She liked it a lot, but preferred the orange glaze better. The second night I had Kushiyaki and it was also delicious! The service was spectacular here as well.

Oh, also, get the mud pie. Even if you aren't sure you can finish it all, you probably will. If you come back the next day and bring your receipt, the mud pie is on the house. Awesome!",Sarah M.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

We scored a great table, water front. Service was very friendly, both times.  We tried a few MaiTais, elsewhere,  and most of them were pretty bad.  This place was the best.  We ordered the pulled pork lettuce wraps and calamari. It's adequate, but not the best food.  I don't think I'd come here for the food at all.
However, I did indulge in the Hula Pie.  My husband said he didn't want any. Ha! No sooner did he try a taste, than he cut a line and exclaimed that half was his!   Now, he wants me to make it at home.",Debby F.,"Monterey, CA",4.0 star rating

The filet was amazing, and the ono was fabulous.  The mai tai and the sorbet were just okay, but we'll give them a pass since the sorbet was on the house as a birthday treat.

2/26/2013,5.0 star rating,"Two parts to this review, the delightful bar and the awesome restaurant. 

1.) The bar.... You know you want a good mai tai when you're in Hawaii. You're tired other places, maybe you haven't been satisfied. Enter Kimo's, they must use fresh juice because they're great. Just try one, embrace the little umbrella and pineapple wedge... as touristy as it looks. Score the first 3 seats when you walk in that face the water, good views. Attentive bartenders. A must try.

2.) The restaurant... Great food. Very savory and excellent service. When you order, your server will share with you the list of fish for the day. Choose how you'd like it prepared from their tasty list (the server will make recs from the chef which fish should be prepared which way) and enjoy.

12/4/2012,4.0 star rating,"Holy overenthusiastic waitstaff, batman! Our waitress was, like, totally psyched to see us, and like totally loved everything on the menu, and like the catch of the day was like totally awesome, and like you totally have to try the Hula Pie, and it's like totally not as cool as Duke's becuase Kimo's was like totally here first!

Her energy notwithstanding, the meal was pretty great. Despite what she said, Kimo's is pretty similar to Duke's, both in menu style and quality. The place definitely did not disappoint. It's the basic Duke's model, they tell you the fresh seasonal catches of the day (mostly all local in Kimo's case) and then you pick your favorite preparation from the list. 

I ended up splitting my meal with another member of my party (for which we were not charged extra), and we ended up both getting what seemed like full portion of rice and extra sides. We went with (per Happy Waitress's suggestion) the local Opakapaka and the coconut-crusted preparation. To. Die. For. 

And of course, we couldn't pass up the Hula Pie. Why would you? It's vacation for goodness sake... calories don't count!

For dinner, they serve freshly caught fish, so their menu changes daily. I had the Mahi-Mahi topped with a lobster salad which had been baked to a nice golden crust. The freshness of the fish was truly present in each bite. The fish was served with a side of rice and mixed vegetables. Overall, one of the best fish I have ever had.

In the past,  I've had  the worst customer service and they maintain consistency with poor quality.   Tonight was a classic case of disappointment. Our fish entrees came out stone cold.  The waiter asked if he could get us something else but the others in our party were already half way done with their dinner,  and we just wanted to get the hell outta there.   
On the way out I asked to speak with the manager. Chris came over to talked to me, and was very unpleasant and unprofessional. I politely informed him the service was not up to par this evening and he argued back that I was wrong. I explained to him that I have dinned at all the other TS restaurants in the chain  and have always had an amazing experience and this was not the case. He still argued back that his service was just as superior.  I simply reminded him that I'm the customer, but obviously the customer's  input doesn't matter at this establishment.

8/25/2014,5.0 star rating,"This review is specifically for the Kimo's classic burger...  the memory of which is seared into my brain and forcing me to write a review many months later.

We were in Lahaina over a year ago, but my wife and I still think back to that one evening we were strolling down Front Street craving something normal and stumbled upon Kimo's.  We had read they have a good burger and decided to give it a shot.

Unfortunately, it was dinner time, and we were actually seated in the main restaurant area, so the menus didn't have the burger listed.  Our waitress gladly helped us avoid disappointment, though, and said she'd be able to have the kitchen make us one.

The burger comes in a pretzel bun and has a meat patty that is blended from better cuts of meat than you might find at other places (certified angus beef chuck, short rib, and top sirloin).  It is juicy and well-composed.  On the surface it's not much different than other burgers--there is no special mix of ingredients or anything.  This is simply a cheeseburger on a pretzel bun (which is beginning to be more popular these days).  But once you bite into it, you begin to appreciate what a shining example of a cheeseburger this is...  the secret is, of course, the meat.

My daughter was very upset,  no permanent physical damage though the dish was very hot.   They gave us a slice of hula pie for free and comped us the burger as well to make up for the accidents.

The fries were pretty good - beer battered.  I agree with Amanda's assessment that that section of Lahaina is a dump. But we were staying at Four Seasons in Wailea so it's hard for anything to measure up to that. And we had to do the tourist thing at least one day.

After two days of not finding a good restaurant and satisfying 6 people, I yelped and read about Kimo's. My brother was determined to try the hula pie so off we went. We arrived at 5:30 pm and was told 15 minutes. 15 soon became 35. All of us were starving and thirsty from a full day of snorkeling. We were finally seated with an older waitress who gave us no smile and no water for another 10 minutes. We order the following:
App #1.Ahi poke and avocado tower: a bit messy but taste was good and avocado and tuna were fresh
App #2. Macadamia nut crusted calamari: battered was dark brown and lacked any flavor
Entree #1-  Arugula salad with grill shrimp: I'm guessing arugula is imported to the island so it is very scarce cause I paid $14.75 for a handful of them scattered on a plate with 4 shrimp. The salad looked so sad that I couldn't even offer it to anyone for i'll be starving from this meal. 
Entrée #2 - Fresh island fish: the special that night was mahi mahi. Now I know that's not an expensive fish/dolphin meat but come on! The portion was the size of my 5 years old niece palm! Really! For 15.75 I would hope my sister can savor the taste with more than 2 bites. It was bland and not well seasoned
Entrée #3 - coconut crusted island fish: similar batter to the calamari with no flavor but old oil. Paid $15.75 to eat deep fried coconut batter. DO NOT FOR SURE ORDER
Entrée # 4 - fresh fish taco: my brother ordered this and ended up picking at his food and searching for the bits of fish in between. :( 
Entree #5 - Hawaiian cowboy or I think that is what the bf ordered. It was similar to a BBQ pulled pork sandwhich for $14.25! Was one of the decent entree there but portion could have been bigger. 
Entree #6 - broke da mouth: with a name like this you think your mouth would be hanging after exhausting yourself from trying to eat all that food. WRONG!  BBQ ribs were dry and only came with 3 ribs. Not sure if the chicken were in skewers but the food did not leave a good fullfilling impression.

11/11/2010,4.0 star rating,"A touristy restaurant in a touristy town, but the food is surprisingly good and not exorbitantly overpriced.

Not to say that it's a cheap meal out, but it is more reasonable than a lot of ""finer"" restaurants in Lahaina.

Oceanfront views, tiki torches and dark wood ship-like interior.

Mix and match fish and sauces, go with the server recommendations.  The parmesan crusted opah was nicely cooked but slightly dry, served with a very tasty buttery herb sauce.  I asked for an extra side of the sauce and it made a world of difference.  

I had a taste of the lobster-stuffed mahi mahi and I would have to say that the opah was the better choice.

I was feeling a bit fish'ed out, so I ordered the slab of ribs - it is a huge caveman portion, tender, juicy meat slathered in a sweet plum sauce - way too much sauce!  Great leftovers for a late-night snack.  

Overall, it definitely beats a meal out at Bubba Gumps.",Janice F.,"Vancouver, Canada",4.0 star rating

Onaga, marlin and mahi mahi and they were well prepared, moist and delicious. One friend had the ribs and he thought they too were equally good.

The way the restaurant is arranged upstairs is tables for two lined up by the railing and large tables for groups of 6+ behind them. No surprise, we ended up with a noisy large group sitting right behind us. Not ideal if you want a peaceful romantic dinner by the sea.
We started with the fire roasted vegetable and goat cheese dip. It was basically build-your-own bruschetta, so kind of messy and awkward, but tasty.
Entrée portions are large, the fish comes with ample rice and vegetables...way too much for me, honestly. My coconut crusted fish was decent. I saved room for the hyped up Hula Pie, which was too large for 2 people to finish. It was okay but I wouldn't get it again. It was more like an ice cream cake than pie.

M husband had something called a Sloppy Jack which turned out to be a sloppy Joe with port instead of beef.  Had slaw on the bun and was really good.  Trying to be sort of healthy I had the catch of the day.  A nice piece of Mahi Mahi with a garlic basil very light sauce.  Came with steamed rice and macaroni salad.

It was true... Awesome happy hour and also the best Mai Tai's around!!  I think the happy hour menu ended at 5pm and we got there just minutes before. The upstairs looked like it might have been a little fancier and only served the full menu, but not starting until 5. We originally just wanted to come in for drinks but ended up ordering food after checking out the menu and deciding to stay and enjoy for awhile.   

I ordered the Fish and Chips and it was amazing. My wife had a Fish Sandwich that she said had way too much bread, but it was still good. 

There are a lot of spots in downtown to check out, but this definitely looked like one of the best. Great menu and awesome location, service was good. I highly recommend this restaurant to people coming to walk around and check out the downtown area.

7/10/2012,5.0 star rating,"Highlights: Beautiful ocean view, prime rib, and the Hula pie

I came twice during my visit to Hawaii.  The first night we had fish with a Hula pie, and the second visit was filled with coconut shrimp, prime rib, and pina coladas.  

I have to say, for a seafood restaurant, the fish weren't my favorite.  Although the flavors and textures were balanced well, the fish itself was slightly overcooked.  It led to a dry and slightly rubbery meal.  But, the Hula pie saved the day.  This pie is the most beautiful dessert ever made.  It isn't overtly sweet with its macadamia ice cream, but the chocolate sauce floods your tongue with sugar if that's how you like it.

If you do come here and you like beef, do not skip out on the 32 oz. prime rib.  It's huge and comes with a bone to hold the slab of meat together, but if you can't finish it, take the rib home for lunch.  Do not miss this dish!  Kimo's probably uses a cow from heaven or something because the meat is so soft and tender it is very close to Kobe.

Service is decent because the servers are helpful without being overbearing.  However, I had to ask for refills on water as well as remind them of forgotten drinks.",Shannon T.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

The food?  A disaster.  The Ahi Poke was old, soft tuna.  Ahi? Maybe.  Tasted more like bait.  The avocado was good, but nobody buys an Ahi Poke for the avocado.

The girls both had burgers off the kids menu.  These were clearly cooked earlier and microwaved.  They looked less tasty than something from McDonalds.

I ordered the prime rib, and it was OK, but the juice seemed a little...  I don't know... Watery?

We has the famous Hula Pie for dessert.  We had it at a couple places this trip, and Duke's made the best one so far.  In fact, the food at Duke's was worlds better and cost less.  Go figure.

The workers in blue were extremely friendly, but our server - can't recall his name - looked like he could care less about the meal or the job.

She never asked if we were done, or wanted anything else.  It was, here's your check...  We had actually been planning to order some appetizers shortly.  That was put to an end as we were both speechless.  I can't remember a time that's ever happened.

We started off with appetizers. My wife and daughter had calamari, which was prepared very well with a tangy/spicy red cocktail sauce. I had the sashimi (market price was $16 for an ample portion). It was lovely, not fishy at all, smooth like butter. I even got my daughter to try it, and she liked it. Normally she's a California roll girl, or deep fried California, with tobiko, but she ventured out, and that was a good thing.

Lunch was wonderful. My wife had the Chinese chicken salad, and finished it, which is unusual for her. She's normally one who leaves a few bites. 

My daughter had the kids fish and chips. She contemplated the full size version, but went with the kids order. It came with fries and two good size portions of fish. She really enjoyed it. 

I had the turkey, bacon, and pesto focaccia sandwich. VERY yummy. I only finished half of it as it was a decent size sandwich, and having had the sashimi, I was already fairly full, plus I needed to leave room for desert. 

For desert we had a slice of the Hula Pie, essentially a huge slice of ice cream cake. Oh my, it was simply delicious, and enough desert for three. Even with a chocolate loving daughter.",BD C.,"Loomis, CA",4.0 star rating

You know, I wish that I would have been hungrier when I dined here. We scored an awesome spot on the water, and the waitress even let me wait to order my wine during HH. I later realized that Happy Hour was nothing to write home about. Oh well.

We shared one of the best cheeseburgers and onion rings I'd had in awhile, and when they mistakenly brought us fries instead of rings, we scored them free of charge. Yay!

The happy hour selection was pretty poor, and I could barely stomach the wine, but how could I really complain about happy hour? They offered  but a couple of selections for happy hour food (some unappetizing ""squid"" that seems to be called calamari in these parts) and I forget what else as it was just 'meh'. 

So I wouldn't really rush here for the ""hour"" but the place still made us happy. And around 2 pm, it  was packed, so what does that tell you?

Also, did not get to try the Hula Pie; was reminiscent of Billy Miner's for those in the know, so personally, I would skip it and get the AWESOME gelato up the street (which is exactly what we did PRIOR to dining here).

We got there at 5:00 sharp, and all the view tables were already gone. We were in the back corner of the restaurant, near the kitchen. It was dark. And loud with kitchen noises. I thought the food would have made up for it, but it didn't.

Myself and my Aunt had the Seared Ahi. It was very good, but the portion was way to small. My uncle had Ono, with some kind of pineapple preparation (?). It was also good, but his portion was even smaller. My girlfriend had the Teriyaki Tenderloin. It was a reasonable size, but quite tough. 

My prior trip, we were seated next to the railing (awesome view), the portions were much bigger, and the steak wasn't tough (we ordered the same dishes both times). I'm not sure if we just got lucky last time, or if we just caught an unusual situation this time, but either way I won't be back. A restaurant needs consistently great food to get my business, especially when it costs around $100 for two to dine.

Incase anyone needs another reason to avoid Kimo's, the whole place screams ""tourist"". They sell T-shirts etc, and there were women selling lei's throughout the dining area (don't even get me started on how much that bothers me....). Kinda kitschy .

I've eaten here several times while in Maui.  I think the best meal I ever had here was a hamburger and a Mai Tai a couple of years ago.  This time I had the Mahi Mahi and it was good, not great.  The Mai Tai's are still great! 

It was dinner time and the service was average.  Because I was alone, I felt that I didn't get the same service as those where there were 2 or more at the table.  Also, had a table in the back, away from the water, even though there was one the same size available on the window.  For this reason I give it three stars.

We also ordered the Filet Mignon and it came NO where close to our prime rib. It was a waste of money and a waste of space in our tummies. The 32 oz prime rib was more than enough food for my bf and I.

3/6/2013,4.0 star rating,"Whenever we come to Maui, we always go to Kimo's for lunch at least once.  I'm way overdue to write this review with how many times we've been here.  You can't beat their outdoor deck on the ground floor with some of the best views in Lahaina.  My favorite items on the lunch menu are the ""Broke Da Mouth"" plate lunch and the caesar salad with grilled fish of the day.

We also recently came here for a light dinner after a long travel day and sat at the bar and ordered off the bar menu.  Note that all of the tables on the deck are open bar seating.  My fiance had a couple Mai Tais, which were delicious and I think the best on the island, and we had the Ahi Poke appetizer and the teriyaki chicken caesar salad.  We were able to enjoy our meal and see the sunset and some whales while we were there.

The service is consistently good at Kimo's.  We have never been there for dinner upstairs in the dining room, which has $30+ entrees, just because we have other favorite restaurants we'd rather go to in that price point.",Leslie C.,"Kirkland, WA",4.0 star rating

Biggest contributor to feeling they don't deserve their 4 star rating was that my fish was overcooked and a bit tough (for that price, I expect better).

We were greeted immediately as we walked into the establishment, and were whisked away to our table upstairs.  Not an ocean view table, which was okay, being 7pm.  We had the sweetest lady who was only taking our drink orders.  Our actual waiter, was great as well.  

I ordered the Mahi Mahi, my husband a steak, and 4 yr old the pork ribs off of the keiki menu.  All were delicious, portions large.  We intended on ordering dessert, but instead asked for to-go boxes because we were so full!

He made some recommendations which we followed and we were very happy with our entire meal, from appetizer and salad through dessert! The calimari was very good, which is always a plus because it seems we always order it. Our fish was snapper, which apparently they don't get very often. It was cooked one way for my husband, another for me, and they were both devine! We topped it all off with a cup of coffee and a complimentary Hula Pie, which by far surpassed the one we had at another restaurant the week before!! Five stars for the atmosphere, waiter and food!

10/3/2012,2.0 star rating,"Time Arrived:  7, weekday

Time Wait:  Reservation at 7, waited 5 min.

Party: 2

Atmosphere:  Probably should have set the reservations earlier to see the sunset., cause we sat upstairs great view of darkness.  For those of you who like to drink and party there, for all the maui restaurants i went to, it was the most... crowded and rowdy (not our thing)

Food/Drink:   Below average for what we ate at maui.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong stuff?  We both had fish, i don't remember anything about it other than it was just meh and the rice that came along with the fish/salad sucked.  Shared a shrimp cocktail and it was also most noatably meh.

Service:  Stuff did not come out quickly.  Waiter asked to refill my drink, but never came back.  Water refills were not made.

Overall:  It was pretty crowded that night, so I can give a pass for sub par service.  But no pass for average at best food at above average prices.",Dave C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",4.0 star rating

7/7/2012,4.0 star rating,"Typical Lahaina/Oceanside restaurant.  Nice views of ocean and Molokai, nice place to watch the sunset.  I can't say the menu is markedly any different than anyplace else of this type in Lahaina.

AMBIENCE:  3 stars--except the view, which I give 4.5 stars!  The place is exactly what you expect a seafood/steak restaurant on the ocean to look like--lots of dark wood, kitchy maritime decor, etc.  The upstairs is a nice place to be up off of the street and to watch the sunset.

SERVICE:  4 stars.  Good hostess, attentive server.

FOOD:  3 stars--complicated story.  I had prime rib (great), kids had kids' filet (great), my wife had fish which is where it got a bit dicey.  She started having an allergic reaction within seconds of trying fish--this has happened twice before, but she eats fish and shellfish many other times without any problems.  We figured it was an isolated reaction to food/spices--did not make a big deal about it, but the astute manager noted she was not eating her food.  He was great, took the plate, removed it from our bill etc--he came back and said he had tried it in the kitchen (obviously from the side she did not eat)--and had the same reaction!  

Bottom line is that fresh fish has little to no HISTAMINE in it, but if it a bit older the histamine content can increase --which can cause an allergic reaction!  Doing some quick internet research we are now experts on histamine toxicity from fish (that also explains my wife's other reactions in the past).  He not only removed it from our bill, but also gave us $20 off our next visit.

Dessert was the Hula Pie--very much loved by the family!

DRINKS:  3.5 stars.  Typical Mai Tai at sunset--nothing to set it apart from the many other Mai Tais in Maui.

MANAGER:  5 stars--for reasons noted above.

VALUE:  3.5 stars--nothing is really cheap in Lahaina.

OVERALL 3.5 to 4 stars.  Not too exciting, but not too bad either.",Christian M.,"Tucson, AZ",4.0 star rating

1/18/2015,5.0 star rating,"Delicious food, great view and excellent service. Made a reservation online and were seated as soon as we showed up. Our table was right on the railing of the upper deck so we had an incredible view of the sunset. Brought a bottle of wine (from Costco) and paid the $20 corkage fee. It's really the way to go. We saved a bundle. They served us carrot muffins and rolls that were hot and mouth watering. I had the Parmesan crusted (Ono fish at the time - this changes depending on what's fresh). Huge piece of fish. Normally I am not a big rice lover but the rice it came with was super tasty and definitely not your rice a roni variety! Fresh veggies accompanied the dish. My husband had the lobster topped (mahi mahi) which was also good. We had a free hula pie coupon (just google it and you can find one to print). It was huge and very good. Life changing? Don't know about that. But I can pretty much scarf down any dessert! Our server was efficient and told us to relax and no rush. He was knowledgeable on the dishes.

8/10/2015,3.0 star rating,This place was ok. The first problem was that it was about 1 million degrees and the only cold place was the bathroom. We waited about 40 minutes for food that came in such small portions. For example my brother got a shrimp platter and it only had about 3 shrimp and it costed about $40. The only good thing was that the waiter was very kind. Plus a good view of the sunset gave it 3 stars.,Kalvin C.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",4.0 star rating
4/27/2010,4.0 star rating,"Read about this place and saw some of the reviews and thought we'd try it out on our last trip out...

First of all; there was a big group of us; 13 and 2 came later, and I was told it would take about 15 min to get us seated.   We ended up waiting over 40 minutes for our table because the other big parties were on island time as well; not the restaurants fault, and thank goodness for the bar :)  and on top of that, they gave us a few free giant shrimp cocktail appetizer orders to make up for the wait(which was really nice of them.  So they got a big plus from them because of that.

Food - Had the fresh island catch, which was fish with rice and somethin else, I forgot..Alyssa reminded me that the sauce was basil lemon butter.   I was really excited to get my order, until it came out.  The portion was really small, even by a small person(like me)'s standards.  I was still hungry after I finished it, which is saying something; and at $13+, definitely not worth it.  It was good tho, don't get me wrong, just not worth the amt paid for it.  Ozakuya provides much-more value for the price.  

Service - Because of the whole large party fiasco, I was very impressed with their service and their attempt to make up for the long delay with seating; it really wasn't their fault.  It was the other parties' faults and ours for not calling in ahead of time.  Either way, i really enjoyed the service and that's why they are a 4 instead of a 3(but I would've marked 3.5 if I had the choice)

Locale - extremely nice, the place overlooks the beach and has outdoor seating exclusively for lunch; for dinner they have upstairs seating, but we were there for lunch.  Really nice views and barring a storm, it's an awesome place to eat and enjoy the scenery.  

Parking on front street can be a little hectic, but we got lucky(afternoons are pretty open on the street, which is free); otherwise, there are the paid lots nearby.  

So a pretty good place with an awesome view that makes up where they lack in quantity with a good bar and good service :)",Jay B.,"Chino, CA",4.0 star rating

11/26/2007,4.0 star rating,"Our lame guidebook Maui Revealed led us far astray and suggested we stop by the downtown of Lahaina. For those familiar with San Francisco it's like a Pier 39, complete with Bubba Gump Shrimp. Total tourist trap district, yikes. I fired up my Yelp Mobile (shameless plug) and prayed that trusty yelpers would save my ass (and that of my family). 

Sure enough y'all came through. Kimo's while not a bastion of elite cooking, does serve up perfectly good fish in a scenic oceanside setting. Much like a bacon wrapped hot dog serves it's purpose at 2am, Kimo's can save you from complete tourist hell. My ""fish"" (I never asked exactly which type, oops!) had a delicious lemon butter sauce. It was cooked okay, a tad drier than I'd prefer, but still in solid tasty territory.

Bottom line: If you can skip Lahaina's downtown all together do so, but if you're hungry and in the neighborhood like I was, Kimo's is a good choice.",Jeremy S.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

4/7/2012,4.0 star rating,"Last year when we were in Maui, we didn't get to eat at Kimo's.  This year we made it a point to go and I am so glad we did!  We arrived shortly before 5 p.m. and we were told that dinner service started at 5 p.m..  There was quite the wait in the lobby, so we decided to return in about 10 minutes.  Once the gates to the upstairs dining room opened at promptly 5 p.m., it was like Costco morning mad dash for the 2nd floor.  Crazy!  Once seated a lovely young lady took our drink orders while we waited for our server, David.  I only remember his name because that is my hubby's name too.  LOL.

We started with their special appetizer of the day, calamari.  It was tasty, fresh and perfectly fried.  My only complaint was it was gone too fast, but in a good way.  The hubby also ordered a ginger martini.  It was like drinking a jolly rancher...and I don't even drink alcohol...Ha!

My son and I split the Koloa Pork Ribs.  It was wonderfully messy, we ate every bite and had some to share.  Great portion size!

My hubby ordered the ""Kimo Style"" Opah.  I had a nibble and it was divine.  Definately ordering that the next time we eat a Kimo's.  My daughter loved it so much that she practically ate his whole entree plus her own Shrimp Tahitian.  That's my girl.

Eventually we got a table after 40 minutes wait.

Then the nightmare begun. To put it short, the waitress is very impatient, rude, and complaining about my English accent in mind, but showed through her dirty look.

That being said we looked at several restaurants and felt we wouldn't find any that were not tourists traps when we found Kimo's. The menu was decent and my husband liked the vibe, at this point I was so hungry I didn't care what we ate. We ordered the fish tacos and some sort of Marlin appetizer( it was served on bread with a horseradish sauce). The fish tacos were good, but the appetizer was amazing.

9/9/2012,3.0 star rating,"A bit overpriced. But great helpful service. Wanted the pink or red snapper that was on the menu but it was out of season so they didn't have it. They should put a disclaimer in the menu by the seafood selection. Had the Opah- very moist and delicious. Husbands medium rare streak was instead well done. Free hula pie with coupon from Expedia store. It's like a mud pie. Great view, little noisy bc they are popular, and a fun bar. If we are in Maui again we just might come here for drinks and the view.

11/16/2009,5.0 star rating,"Knowing that Kimo's was part of the Duke's family of restaurant, we made a reservation to dine here for a sunset dinner before we came to Maui.  Boy, was I happy with our seat!  Above the lower deck, overlooking the ocean, watching the sailboats sail by, and with the style of the restaurant itself, we felt like we were on our own cruise ship!

Our server at Hula Grill, where we dined the night before, semed very excited for our dinner at Kimo's and advised me to try the 32oz. prime rib since I love prime rib.  O - M - G... seriously it was the biggest steak I'd ever seen or had [see photo proof].   Egads !  I think I was instantly full when I saw the server bring it out to me!  Overall food was great.  I ended up only eating about a 1/3 of my prime rib.  But no worries!  We decided to pack it for our ""Road to Hana"" drive the next day and our server provided us with extra rolls to make sandwiches.  Was that the best idea ever!  We sliced up the prime rib and made sandwiches for our to go box.  They were soooo yummy the next day and we were so happy to have had them!

We had the pork lettuce wraps and they were great! But that was the only great thing the entire night.... We asked for our servers advice on selecting our entrees, they all sounded delicious. I ordered the Marlin coconut crusted and he ordered the Ono parmesan crusted. We eat a lot of seafood back home and are pretty familiar with many types of fish. The marlin was so dry and overcooked, I could barely cut through it with my fork. I've had meatier fish (ex swordfish) before and this was just awful. It was like chewing beef jerky. The server offered to make a new entree for me, I hated being that person to return my dinner but it was just bad. My husbands Ono was okay, we've had it elsewhere since being in Maui and it was much better other places. The server brought the citrus Munchong within a few minutes. The Munchong was cooked much better, it was very tasty. It came along with asparagus and shaved Parmesan, delicious right?? WRONG! The asparagus was cold! It must have been cooked prior and then they attempted to heat it up but it was disgusting. Overall, we were so disappointed in the decision to eat at Kimo's. I would rather have eaten at a chain restaurant, at least that's what it felt like by the end of the night. They over-promise and under-deliver .... Think again before eating here.

I would say that the highest compliment that can be given would come from a non-fish eater, which I generally am.  I am that person who is afraid to order fish because I would get that bad piece that would ruin my dinner experience.
Well, I went out on a limb and ordered the Parmesan crusted Opah.  Wow! So amazing!  I give all the credit to our fabulous waiter who recommended it.  He actually did a great job convincing me.

Locals do eat here. That is the ones that can afford it. This place is fantastic. It is a great place to get fresh fish. The only knock about this place is sitting upstairs in one of the back corners. It can get stuffy up there certain times of the year and offers no view.

This is not the cheapest place to eat fresh fish in Maui. That would be the Fish Market in Paia. But this is one of the best meals you are going to have on this side of the island.

If you do not like fish then order the Prime Rib. If you do not like fish or prime rib then this place is not for you. There is cheeseburgers in paradise down the street. And yes that is a tourist trap and yes, locals do not eat there! ;)",J K.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating

2/6/2012,2.0 star rating,"My husband and I are presently on company vacation in Maui. After spending the day driving, our group who consisted of business associates and their families decided to have lunch at Kimos. We were all from California and found the place from Yelp and read good reviews about the restaurant. We had to wait for almost half an hour before we were seated, that was alright.

We were shown to our table where our server gave us the menu then left without asking us if we wanted anything to drink.  She was going around while we looked at the menu, then came back to us after a good 10 minutes.  She took our orders then left again. We patiently waited for another half an hour for our food to arrive. Not once our server stopped by to assure us that our food was coming.  When the food was finally served, that was the last time that we ever had interaction with our server.  We were never asked if we wanted any steak sauce or hot sauce, or water, or anything per se (but we had ketchup!)  Again, that was alright. 

The food was good, specially the iceberg lettuce that came with the steak.  The cocktails were also good.  My bbq pork ribs were burnt, but that was still alright.  I was just happy that our food finally came.  We finished our meal, still there was no server.  She was busy taking care of all her customers except us.

My husband tried asking another server for water but was ignored.  We finally had it. My husband had to raise his voice to ""get"" the other server's attention, explaining that we couldn't find our server.  The other server left, then our server came back with our water.

Everyone was already so upset with her, but still kept cool.  She started clearing our table, then came back again with the bill.  Then she handed out 4 wet wipes; there were 6 adults, and 2 kids in our group. When we got our bill, there was an automatic gratuity charge of 18% for parties of 8 and more.  Our 8th person was a year and a half and wasn't served anything!  We paid the bill and my husband went to talk to the restaurant manager to complain about the subpar service we had. 

The manager was understanding and offered us a free lunch which we declined.  My husband even apologized for going off on her.  He just made her promise that she was going to talk to the server and make sure nobody else gets treated the way we were treated.

I mean seriously awesome! Between the three of us, we had the Parmesan crusted Ono, the lobster filled Tilipia, and the Prime Rib. Each was extremely good!

The food here was great! The seafood options were amazing and the portions were pretty large. It is pretty pricey, but i mean it is quality seafood. I had the lobster tail which was good but a little overcooked. My brother and father had the Prime Rib which they thoroughly enjoyed. You have to TRY THE HULA PIE!

When we arrived they had the patio awning drawn and this inhibited our view from the sunset, and made it a bit stuffy.

I had the pacific red snapper that was the special of the day and it was prepared perfectly, although my wife's cioppino was a little too spicy for her.

I wasn't crazy about the mu shu kalua pork, but my Hubs loved it.  Sure, the pork was tender and tasty, but it was soaking in water/jus and, when wrapped in the provided tortillas (with cabbage & red onion), it was super messy.
The view can't be beat - it is amazing.  The bar seemingly hangs right over the ocean, and if the tide is high, the tables on the edge will get splashed (which is great fun to watch if you aren't sitting at those tables).",Robyn W.,"Edmonton, Canada",4.0 star rating

8/5/2014,1.0 star rating,"Just finished dinner at Kimo's. Views are amazing, but dinner was the worse ever ! I'm not one for complaining but it was nasty. We were a table of 6 and I ordered the special, the surf and turf which was suppose to be a ribeye and mahi mahi. When dinner came out, my steak was super well done, I ordered it medium rare, and the size of the steak was a little larger than a dollar coin. I sent it back, 15 mins later after my whole family was done eating, my second plate showed up with a steak that was so small and so tough, more like a cheap piece of sirloin, it was cooked medium well. The piece of fish was disgusting - keep in mind this is Maui where the fish is caught every day, this was not even close to fresh. 

Anyways, after telling the waitress that it was the worse meal ever, she offered me a free dessert ! I said no and for her to take my dinner off - she did so with resistance, but I still tipped her 20% on a $200 bill since I know it was not her fault.

We ate here, in costume, on Halloween 2011.  We had reservations and the place was packed...really packed.  Front Street was packed and in full party mode.

We were totally amazed with the great service when at least 50 people were seated upstairs at the same time.  We sat in amazement as we watched the staff serve a swarm of people all at once.  We expected that they would struggle but they really had it together.  Compliments to the staff and their management team.

Even for the price the food was remarkable.  The menu was varied and our waitress was amazing.

If they are in your price range, you haven't experienced Maui unless you have had dinner at Mama's and a sunset dinner at Kimo's.

The only draw back is parking is terrible.  This is certainly a place where valet parking would be a big plus.  However, since they are jammed seemingly all the time, valet parking probably wouldn't get them enough additional customers to justify the cost.  Besides, where would the valets find parking?

The street Halloween costume party was really fun.  Lot's of great and wild costumes.  Everyone was having a great time parading up and down Front Street.

Ask for a table on the deck with the shorter bar menu. The food is still delicious, it's cheaper (!), and you get a great view with an ocean breeze. 

I ordered the Mu Shu Kalua Pork. The meat was delicious and served with shredded cabbage onions and this mouth watering plum sauce. If you're going low-carbs, ignore the wraps and you still have a delicious meal! 

We were in Maui celebrating two friend's 30th birthdays and we just happen to mention that to our server. She brought out a free hula pie for us come dessert time. Holy moly was that thing good. It was my first time sampling one and I can honestly say it made me a very happy woman.",Julia N.,"Elk Grove, CA",4.0 star rating

I got a Chi Chi Lava Flow, which is a coconut pineapple strawberry vodka drink, and was the best I have ever had. I ordered the Cioppino and my husband had the Prime rib. The Cioppino was excellent, and the tomato sauce could have been used with spaghetti and been one of the best I have ever had in a restaurant. The prime rib was large and tasty. A couple at the next table gave us a coupon for a free hula pie.

There were about 50 people waiting for seating when the restaurant opened and like a well oiled machine, the staff seating all of us in about 10 minutes or less.

Food still good but not great, but service was great. I'm upping them to a 4 and would recommend them to visitors to Maui.

9/16/2011,3.0 star rating,"We stopped here on our last day in Maui on a detour to the airport (we wanted more shave ice before we left!)

The highlight of this place is the view - if you eat here, eat before/during sunset. We sat upstairs, but I wish we would have sat in the bar area. The decor and vibe upstairs was more formal than we were looking for - it is dark and heavy, not really in synch with the view.

On to the food...
*Bread basket - the carrot muffins are amazing, my hubby loved the sourdough rolls - this might be worth the calorie splurge
*Beet salad - I had this and it was delicious. I ordered it because I wanted to have some Surfing Goat cheese, which was featured on the salad.
*Iceberg and Blue Cheese Salad - my husband had this and really enjoyed it - I didn't even get to steal a taste!
*Mahi Kimo Style - I had this and it was really delicious. Compared to the other preparation styles, this sounded almost boring, but it was perfect. I'm a fish lover and I don't want to hide the flavors of very fresh fish.
*Mahi Lobster Stuffed - My hubby had this and it was good. Very rich. I scored a piece of this and it was delicious, but the mahi really became a carrier for the lobster stuffing and was somewhat lost. 

I am almost embarassed to say that we skipped the Hula pie. BUT we were going for shave ice and while it looked amazing, we couldn't be tempted from our shave ice.

While dinner was good, I think this place would be an awesome lunch spot and/or happy hour spot - mostly due to the fact that you'd dine on the lanai instead.",Meredith R.,"Arlington, VA",4.0 star rating

Food wise place is spot on, we got the fried calamari, it was a pretty small portion but tasty.  As our entrees, the wife got the mahimahi baked and I got  the prime rib mid-rare.  Wife said her mahimahi was great, and my prime rib was a pleasant surprise as well.  Apparently they run out of the prime rib very often so I was happy I got to try it.  All in all we had a great experience, our waitress was superb and the food was great.

I'd say the overall level of service is better at Subway, and the food is about the same quality, but a whole lot cheaper!

We came for the view but should have gone to Lahaina Grill where there is no view but impeccable service.

The drinks were tasty, but the ahi tuna appetizer was appalling. When our waiter brought it to us and asked me to see how great it looked, my first thought was ...where is the fish?? The sashimi was so red and thinly sliced it honestly looked to be some type of garnishing on the bed of leaves it sat on. I genuinely thought it was tomato or something close to it. 

For entrees I had the filet mignon and the bf had prime rib. Nothing spectacular, and a little over done for my piece when I asked for medium rare. Overall, the meal was decent, but definitely lacked substance.

I think the only real thing I enjoyed about the meal was that they sat us near the water and so there was a really nice ambiance to the place. Good thing we weren't right up against the deck or else we would have been sprayed by the ocean water like the guests next to us...it was definitely entertaining to say the least!

The potato was overly soaked in butter (I swear it was swimming in it) but was perfectly done.

Previously, we had ono in garlic, lemon and basil which was tender and pretty good. We also had the hula pie, which is the reason I returned to Kimo's. That huge slice of ice creamy goodness is amazing.

2) Fish was AWESOME- monchong parm crust to die for!!!!  Lobster equally good!  Pricing was awesome compared what you would pay in CA, and freshness and preparation were unbeatable.

I didn't expect a huge portion, but seriously the fish was approximately 2x2 inches in size with 5 small pieces of pineapple!  Wow.  And 4 small ribs with 5 pieces of pineapple.

We took the maui bus from our hotel in Kaanapali to the Papalaua Street stop. The restaurant is in a good location near the wharf and all the small shops. It has a pretty nice setup, with most of the tables on a large open patio. We got a table with a great view of the ocean, too. 

We ordered the tiger shrimp cocktail ($11.50) as an appetizer. My sisters ordered the ""Broke Da Mouth Plate Lunch"" ($11.95) which includes 2 pieces of teriyaki chicken on skewers, pork ribs, rice and macaroni salad. My mom ordered the fresh island fish plate ($13.95) and I ordered the coconut crusted island fish ($13.95). The tiger shrimp tasted pretty good, but you only get 5 pieces, so it's not much bang for your buck. The teriyaki chicken was very good, not dry as I expect most skewers to be. The ribs were okay, tender and flavorful, but not outstanding. The macaroni salad was not the best, we've had better on the island. I especially enjoyed my coconut crusted island fish though. It had a great pineapple salsa topping, crispy crust and the fish was very flaky. Hands down the best dish of the 3 we tried.

While we were eating we saw many slices of hula pie ($6.95) being ordered left and right. So we got one slice to share. It was amazing! Sharing it between 3-4 people is just right, 2 people may be doable if you have a sweet tooth like me. There is a cookie crust, vanilla macadamia nut ice cream center, a  1/2 inch layer of fudge on top, finished with a drizzled layer of hot fudge, chopped macadamia nuts and whipped cream topping.

5/31/2011,4.0 star rating,"This outdoor seaside joint found off of Front St. in Lahaina is a fantastic venue to spend dinner during sunset. It was also a special evening sharing the meal with friends on their honeymoon. 

The decor is integrated from an older building with contemporary ammenities and not too loud that you had to loose your voice to make conversation. The typical tiki torches line the area and live music gave it a nice touch. The dining room is separated into 2 major areas: 1st floor with outdoor tables and the bar near the entrance, the 2nd floor had indoor tables. Be aware that your glass of water or Mai Tai might have leaves fall from the large tree that splits the outdoor dining porch.

The wait staff was very friendly on a first name basis and service was great. The restaurant fills up quickly as the night progresses so reservations are highly recommended especially if you want to be seated outside. Street parking is limited.

The seafood was great and the other entrees were good. The portions were plentiful paired with a cesar salad and appentizers are not necessary. They also provide complimentary bread that also includes carrot bread.

What we ordered:
- Mu Shu Kalua pork appetizer - pulled pork with tangy BBQ sauce, can get extra wraps - recommend
- Baked Kimo's style Opah - highly recommend 
- shrimp and steak
- koloa pork ribs - large rack with the same BBQ as the appetizer - recommend 
- Mai Tai's - recommend, couldn't taste the alcohol 
- Hula pie - large slice of macadamia ice cream pie with chocolate (free with coupon)

It was so good though...we ate almost the whole thing!! my advice is to go for lunch (less wait, cheaper prices) and find a coupon for a free hula pie in one of those touristy magazines...you'll find one since that coupon is in all the printed ads for this place!",Diana W.,"Denver, CO",4.0 star rating

I've only had their pork ribs, caesar salad, and sashimi plate. They were all fantastic.
The sauce for the ribs is sooo good. The salad and sashimi were fresh. The dressing was strangely amazing.

The service is ""ehhhh."" So don't expect them to wipe your ass when you're done.

10/12/2012,4.0 star rating,"We dined here twice on our honeymoon -- once for dinner on the upper level and once for a drink and appetizer on the lower level at the bar. It got a recommendation from my dad who visited Maui and our surfing instructor local.

Dinner: seared ahi with cabbage slaw (me) and orange-ginger glazed ono (Husband). The fish was incredibly fresh and prepared well - we actually ended up swapping plates halfway through because he really loved the tuna and I thought the glazed ono was amazing. The orange-ginger crust was very flavorful and unique, and the ono was super firm and mild. Each entree came with a salad, and the meal also included bread and carrot muffins - very delicious and moist!

Drinks/appetizers: the drinks are nothing out of the ordinary - standard Maui beers on tap and fruity cocktails. Did not have a Mai Tai here, but we did at Duke's (which is owned by the same people) and it was nothing to write home about. We ordered tiger shrimp cocktail and macadamia-crusted calamari to eat. Shrimp were large and fresh; about five per order. Calamari was fabulous! They use calamari steak, so it's long strips and very meaty (as opposed to the standard calamari rings). Not too much breading so it's not just greasy and fried tasting. I definitely recommend ordering those. 

Overall, Kimo's has a great view right on the water, friendly service and great food. It's not the cheapest place in Maui (I think our dinner for two was about $100 after tip for two entrees and half a bottle of wine), but it's not the most expensive either.

11/18/2011,4.0 star rating,"Wandered the streets of Lahaina tonight, looking for a light meal since none of us was very hungry.  We found the open-air seating at Kimo's and were seated immediately at a table in the second floor dining area.

Our server and a cocktail server were both at our table within a minute of being seated.  Once we got the beers sorted out, we had a chance to hear the catches of the day and the specials.  I kind of stopped listening after I heard ""ahi poke"", since poke is one of the reasons I come to the islands!  So much for not being hungry... I ordered the poke (cames with chips and guacamole- I'd never had this combination before and let me tell you - poke and guac is a perfect dish) and it was delicious!  Light and buttery- melt-in-your-mouth perfect.

Our server listed the catches of the day and gave us the chef's recommendations for preparation, but you have a great ""mix-n-match"" option of fish and cooking options.  I opted for the coconut-crusted silver marlin, which came with a pineapple salsa and was covered in a spicy Thai penut sauce.  I've never tried marlin before (it's hard to even write that after watching Finding Nemo), so I'm not sure if it was done right... but it was *perfect* for me!  Light and flaky, with a crust that was not greasy or overpowering - just a delicious crispy covering of coconut.

After all that, we had no more room for dessert, but I hear the pie is famous... so maybe we'll come back before we leave next week.",Diana E.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

There was also a ton of fat and left about 1/3 of it was not edible.  I got the Opah fish dish with lobster on top.  The fish was overcooked and dry on one side and moist on the other end.  The lobster salad on top was so covered in mayo and I couldn't taste the lobster at all.  The ice cream pie dessert was good, but nothing to write home about.  It just tasted like ice cream with hot fudge and nuts.

We were seated in the back of the restaurant, no pretty ocean view for us. We were so hungry we didnt even mind but the food was mediocre at best. We had the poke tower, poke was indeed the best but there was maybe 7chunks on a huge scoop of guacomole, also bit into unripe avocado and that unpleasant. We had the goat cheese with chutney and that was actually very good but then the main course came out. Husbands BBq ribs were super dry and tough, i felt so bad that he had to eat that bc he wanted the fish and i changed his mind to get the ribs bc, he loves ribs :( my filet mignon was cooked perfectly but they paired it with this salad that had a lemon/shallot Beurre Blanc  sauce which didnt mix with the steak at all.

Service: Dear Hostess, if you see that I have a baby in a stroller, and you plan on leading us up a flight of stairs, please tell us ahead of time that stairs are involved, and ask us if we need help getting the stroller up there, instead of going up the stairs yourself, and leaving me behind.

The teriyaki steak was the best entree of the bunch.  And the breads they served with the meal were delicious, including the interesting twist of carrot muffins which I could not stop nibbling on.  I don't know that I would RUSH to get back here, but I would certainly try it again.  Our dinner was actually pretty fun because we had a celebrity sighting and had our pictures taken with him.

5/28/2011,3.0 star rating,"Best part of the meal: Hula Pie! It's a gigantic ""slice"" of macadamia nut ice cream on top of an oreo cookie crust, and covered with chocolate fudge. So good. My husband and I split a piece of the hula pie after dinner, and it was delicious and perfect to share with someone. My husband was pretty horrified when I told him I could probably eat at least 2 slices in one sitting minus dinner. :)

Anyway, the rest of the food was only okay -- pretty typical island fair. I had the Kalua ribs, which were good but forgettable. The sauce was very sweet and too thick on top, because they put a big layer right on top of the gigantic rack of ribs. My husband and the steak and shrimp. The steak was okay, but the shrimp which had butter and parmesan, were delicious, juicy, and plump. 

The rolls and carrot muffins that came with the meal were also wonderful! 
 
Great service and beautiful views from the lower and upper floors of the restaurant. They also have these great screen shades to protect your eyes from the sunset while it's setting but they put up the screens after the sun has set a little bit, and it was beautiful! 

Love that hula pie.

Nothing better than a great dinner on a warm night right next to the ocean!! The bread basket to start off was filled with freshly baked dinner rolls and mini pumpkin muffins. The muffins were so good we asked for seconds! I ordered the grilled Ono. It was cooked perfectly with a light cream sauce w/ capers. My first time trying Ono, it had the meatiness of chicken. The rice pilaf paired nicely with my fish. Others in my party ordered the seared tuna, lobster filled Opah and tristan's lobster tails. All were enthusiastically satisfied with their orders. Main courses ranged from $22-40! On the pricey side, but so is almost everything in Hawaii. The great service from our super attentive server made it all worth it!!

In addition, we got a lobster tail (gross and chewy) and coconut shrimp (average) to share. We also got a Caesar salad to share which again was nothing special. The service was below average and it took forever to get our food. The rest of our party got the filet mignon (not the best), Sirloin steak (no complaints) and a chicken meal (something she could've made at home) the only reason I gave 2 stars is because the view is unreal...it ALMOST makes one forget you are paying a butt load for gross food.",Gloria H.,"Mesa, AZ",4.0 star rating

We arrived between 5 & 8 and took advantage of their new happy hour deals, I think my well vodka/soda was about $4, which is pretty incredible. They also offered half off Calamari, which I normally don't like and won't touch, but theirs was perfect- soft and meaty, not tough or rubbery at all.

-- The smoked swordfish was good.  Well smoked and very flavorful.
-- The beet salad had bits of red beets and yellow beets.  More beets in the salad would have been nice.
-- The mahi-mahi was just okay.  Being in Maui, I expected a lot more fresher taste.
-- The pork ribs were good but not spectacular. Ribs that are just as good can be found at other cheaper joints. Only accompanying side was a scoop of basmati rice.  Coleslaw or beans would have gone better.

Makes my mouth water again just writing the review. 

And just to give a little cred to our Creator, Kimo's is an open air restaurant that looks out over the water. Having one of the most amazing meals of my life as the sun set over the isles was pretty spectacular!

NOTE: Went back with a large party. Six of them ordered the Teriyaki Sirloin. Throughout the meal, they were thanking me for recommending it. The others in our party went with various fish entrees, and were equally pleased with the food.",Mike G.,"Hurst, TX",4.0 star rating

We sat on the patio and enjoyed the water coming up.  If we had sat in at the table in front of us, we would have been wet.  We saved enough room to share a hula pie for dessert.

6/18/2014,5.0 star rating,"Yum! We enjoyed a wonderful lunch with our kids. I was super impressed with how the staff handled our food allergy concerns. Our waitress made sure to go tell the kitchen manager and even came back to confirm with us that the kitchen manager was aware of the food allergy. Even on the mainland servers rarely come back to tell me that the manager is aware. The pina colada was great and our waitress was kind enough to fetch a second drink umbrella so I would have one for each of my 2 kids. I had an amazing pulled pork sandwich. I can't remember what my husband ate, but I know he really enjoyed whatever it was as well. Great view, although don't sit too close to the railing on the lower left side when you enter the back patio. Diners there ""may get wet.""",Amanda L.,"Concord, CA",4.0 star rating
8/8/2011,4.0 star rating,"The ribs are on the sweet side but absolutely delicious and very tender. Seafood cioppino was not too watery and filled with seafood, although the fish was too well done and could be softer- it was probably left in the pot for too long. They had free dinner rolls and carrot muffins which were delish! The Ahi was good- it came with wasabi and mangoey dressing that went well the salad underneath. Mango colada was super yum, and got me feeling the sunset overhead. I couldn't taste any alchy in it and I didn't get red so they probably didn't put too much in there anyways. We tried two beers: the Big Wave which was a pale ale and the Mana Wheat was pineapplely and sweet. Both made in Maui. Overall, great service, wonderfully romantic view of the sunset, and great tasting food.",Michele C.,"Irvine, CA",4.0 star rating

10/9/2012,5.0 star rating,"Good food for lunch & GREAT food for dinner. Their lunch & kids menu has recently expanded. Great views from the west shores of Maui, right on the waterfront. Known for the Mai Tai's in the Tiki man glass, Planko-Crusted Calamari, & the Prime Rib Steak cooked to perfection that I recommend you take surfing and add the Lobster tail with the lemon tarragon glaze. Just AMAZING! and lets not forget the landmark Hula Pie for dessert. 

For lunch I'd recommend the Fish Tacos w/ Tropical Salsa or the Coconut crusted Swordfish w/ peanut sauce. Overall great quality your probably gonna want to make reservations for dinner to be safe. Kimo's Restaurant has been a Maui staple for the last 40 years and hands down beats all the commercial touristy locations surrounding it. If you find yourself in Lahaina Downtown this is a must try.

We started with iced teas and an artichoke app.  The artichoke was AWESOME and the iced teas were also perfect.

Four of the five of us got the fish taco, which was SO fresh and had great salsa and tartar-esque dill sauce.  The side caesar salad was good, or as my mom saw it, ""THE BEST CAESAR. EVER.""

Out waitress actually split our meal onto separate plates for us! It was nice! And actually, it is quite a lot of food. With three drinks, appetizer and one meal the bill was about $50. The food was good but nothing extreme to rave about.

We really wanted to try the hula pie because everyone raves about it but we were too full. Be sure to make reservations and Ask to be seated on the deck- it was beautiful and they had a live singer out there was well.",Molly S.,"Minneapolis, MN",4.0 star rating
5/26/2011,3.0 star rating,"My husband and I went here for dinner on our last night in Maui. We wanted to make sure saw the sunset so we made a reservation for the top deck. Even though we arrived a bit early for the reservation they were ready for us and took us directly to our table. The view is of the super blue waters with boats in the distance, some tiki torches which are lit at night fall, palm trees, and the sunset. We both ordered one of their specialty
drinks to start which came out quick and were strong and delicious. My husband ordered the the shrimp and steak plate. He loved the shrimp but thought the steak was just okay. I ordered the iceberg lettuce since that was one of the only vegetarian options. I wasn't impressed with my salad nor the price of it but it was fresh. The one thing that I did LOVE was the pumpkin muffins and rolls. Mmmmmmm!! They were super delicious and filled me up nicely with my salad. The service was very slow while we were there. I ordered a second drink and finally got it after asking a third waitresses. There was a guitar player performing on the lower deck at sunset. We weren't able to hear as clear but it was nice. This is a good place to go for dinner but not the best for a vegetarian or someone you doesn't like fish.",Jenn S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
12/23/2011,4.0 star rating,"The view from Kimo's is phenomenal.  I expected a great view, but was actually quite pleased with how good the food was.

I ordered a teriyaki steak, which was excellent - on par with the quality you would expect from a steakhouse.  The meal starts with bread, it comes with a Caesar Salad, and the steak is served with mashed potatoes.

My wife ordered coconut glazed fish, which she really liked as well.  The fish came with rice, the bread, and the Caesar Salad.

The two dinners, including 1 Mai Tai, came to $75 with tip/tax.

Tip for those of you who want to eat dinner: arrive at about 4:45-4:50 or so.  The dining room opens at 5PM.  If you are here at that time you can get ""front row"" seats on the balcony for the AMAZING view as you as you enjoy dinner.  This place is pricey so I would not come here more than once per trip; however, make sure you get a good view or you are wasting half of the value of eating at Kimo's.

His came with a rice mix and mine came with white rice.  Service was good.

You're right on the water, feeling the tradewinds while you enjoy your meal.  The food was great!  I had the sashimi, which was like butter!  On a previous visit I had enjoyed an amazingly delicious grilled opakapaka.  Alas on this evening, it wasn't on the menu, but when I asked the server, low and behold, an order of opakapaka appeared.  Score!  It's a very light and buttery whitefish local to the Maui waters and it is oh-so tasty.

I thought it was a Japanese restaurant when I first saw the sign. We chose the ""fresh fish"" pick. I picked baked ""Kimo's"" style and it came out kinda baked kinda seared (not cooked all the way through) and was really tasty. I loved the garlic sweet lemony sauce, but with a little more pucker, so I squeezed extra lemon on it and it was great. Hubby got the baked coconut crusted ""fresh pick"". Both were good, and the fish is really fresh plus the price was right.

Then, I had the coconut crusted fish and it was super moist and flavorful. I definitely enjoyed it just wish it came with a bit more vegetables. My fiance got the fish and chips and he cleaned his plate...something he rarely does!! SO I bet they were pretty fresh and tasty too.

Honestly, it reminds me that obligatory Fisherman's Wharf crab dinner I have to take my out of town relatives to just so they can say they've been to Fisherman's Wharf for a crab dinner.
FYI if you sit at their bar, you can order from their bar AND dinner menu.  If you sit at a table, you can only order from their dinner menu - information I was not aware of due to the fact the bartender handed me ONLY the dinner menu even though I sat at the bar.  It's ok, not a problem, I was on vacation and wasn't tripping.  
So I ordered one of the fishes baked ""Kimo's Style"" and it was good.  But for the meal and two drinks, the tab came out to about $50 with tax.  A little pricey, but again, I'm on vacation so it wasn't a problem.

We came 3 times during our week on Maui because of how inexpensive it made their wonderful food. The service was friendly and prompt and the view was wonderful (waterfront with outdoor options). We were there over Thanksgiving week and never had to wait to be seated. As for the food:

1) Calamari appetizer = awesome (got this 3 times)!
2) Pulled pork sliders = also awesome
3) Fish tacos were very good and sometimes on special

7/28/2010,2.0 star rating,"So. I have a belief that if you can't smell the food cooking when you walk into a restaurant, bad things are about to happen. Welcome to Kimo's... Service staff very nice. Not sure why they need the females to wear extremely tight/short uniforms - kinda felt like Hooters meets North Shore. Whatever...
If you are hungry I beg you to fill up on the yummy bread and muffins before your meal. THE PORTIONS ARE SIZED FOR TODDLERS. We ordered the bbq rib plate for the little people from the keiki menu - $11.00. Ordered the rib plate from the main menu $22.00. THEY WERE THE EXACT SAME PORTIONS. The taste/flavor was a step above wedding/hotel/hospital food. 

Pissed and still hungry...

Very over priced. Very overrated. I am very pissed and very hungry. Make reservations or you wait up to an hour for a table to eat your ""kid's meal"".
But, on the bright side you will have an amazing view while you enjoy your snack.

We had a large rectangle table and a round table seated at the end. I was seated where the round table and rectangle table met, which was kinda uncomfortable. 

Since this place had good reviews and it was pricey, I figured it'd at least be good. We ate at I'O two nights before and loved the fish, so I figured I'd give it another try. 

I ordered the Opah, kimo style. After my first bite, I almost gagged. It was SO extremely DRY. After EVERY bite, I had to take a drink of water. It was awful. I can't believe I paid $33 for this. Just horrible.

9/10/2010,2.0 star rating,"It would appear that the reviews of this place are skewed heavily on the polar ends of the spectrum.  You almost want and need to review this place on two criteria to do it justice- the ambiance and the food.  Since the food must take precedence, its rating suffers in my book.

The location and atmosphere is worthy of at 4-5 stars.  You're right on the water and even when dark with limited view out to the ocean, it's tough to beat.  It's also conveniently located in Lahaina to all the touristy stuff.  It's definitely a tourist type of place but fun nonetheless.  There was live music on a Thursday when I was there and they are open later than most eateries in Maui (which is annoying... why does everyone close at 9 or so?!?).  I arrived at about 8:45pm and was promptly seated, no reservations, no waiting.  The place was hopping but service was prompt.

The food sadly falls way short.  The fish options were decent as one would expect considering it is Maui.  The were also several ways you could have the fresh fish prepared, none of which set itself apart from the others- screaming ""must try"".  Any changes to the standard Caesar salad incurred a $4. surcharge on top of the already overpriced menu.  I opted for a different salad but not worth the upcharge.

Our entrees were okay- not great but not terrible either.  Even if you were to disregard the price, it's still just mediocre food.  Kimo's is part of the Duke family of restaurants, if that helps.  Can't comment on dessert as I didn't have any.  Too many other places for treats in Lahaina to try!",Michael L.,"Houston, TX",4.0 star rating

The only downside was the wait time for our lunch...took a long 20 m ins or so after we ordered (and ordered a salad, sandwhich and ahi ap so not sure what the holdup was). I was most impressed with the service....they were so on top of things and it was great when I heard other servers ask ours for help. She was getting a little overwhelmed, they all picked up on it right away and jumped in. One filled my moms tea while another got us another round of mai tais. I was very happy that they did that and were happy to. We were sitting close the the bar area/wait station and being a former waitress I notice these things.

You could tell that the seafood was very fresh. The shrimp had that bouncy quality, where you could tell it was not a frozen shrimp.

5/13/2011,3.0 star rating,"You go to Kimo's to watch the beautiful sunset, but start off slightly disappointed with the view of the wall. Apparently you need to request a sunset view seat when you call ahead to make your reservation. By the time we figured that out and asked, there was an hour wait for tables by the rail. We got up out of our seats to snap a few shots of the sunset.

I think I read another review that they try to rush you through dinner. I felt that vibe initially - they must have come at least three times for our order when we hadn't even opened the menu yet. And I am not a slow paced diner. Once they caught on, our server backed off, but I think that she may have backed off a little too much. She totally spaced on bringing us our caesar's and needed to be reminded upon bringing us our food out. She did feel genuinely bad and offered to buy us free dessert (yum hula pie), but we were so stuffed that we couldn't even do it.",Amy K.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating

We were seated right away on the 2nd floor of the restaurant and faced out towards the ocean.  It didn't take us long to decide what we wanted for dinner.  We ordered a couple of Mai Thais to numb the memory of being stuck on the road to Hana for hours.  To start our meal, we had Cesar salads and they were gone in the blink of an eye.  Now for the main event, Joe had the Mahi Mahi stuffed with lobster and I feasted on the Teriyaki Sirloin.

Both entrees were phenomenal and made up for the horrific meal at Cheeseburger in Paradise the night before.  Joe's fish was so light and cooked to perfection.  As for my steak, it was cooked to my preference and came with a side of teriyaki sauce for dipping and mixing with my mashed potatoes.

We simply shared an entree and were right to do so due to the huge portion size. Had a well mixed lava flow. The only other complaint is everyone acting like the stupid tourists they were and taking 9 million pictures right on top of us while we were eating.

We came here for lunch around 11:30 on a Monday with a party of 6 and got a table on the deck closest to the beach.  We had the following entrees: Fish Tacos, Beer Battered Fish and Chips, Coconut Crusted Mahi Mahi, Chicken Sandwich, and Cheeseburger.  The Fish Tacos was more like a fish burrito: one large tortilla with two big pieces of fish inside along with a mayonnaise-heavy coleslaw and pineapple relish/salsa.  The caesar salad that came with it was ok.  The fish from the Fish and Chips was mostly batter but the fries were good and crispy.  The Coconut Crusted Mahi Mahi was our favorite entree out of all them.  

Now the Hula Pie was outrageously good!  Hula Pie is a Hawaiian specialty, or so I've been told, which is basically an ice cream pie.  Macadamia nut ice cream, cookie crust, fudge, chopped macadamia nuts and oodles of whipped cream.

8/10/2010,3.0 star rating,"The thing we liked best about Kimo's was the environment.  It's a really hopping spot, and of course that should be no surprise as popular as it is on Maui.  I love all of the open air, on both levels, and the lighting reminds you of exactly where you are.

I've learned that you can't expect much from a kitchen in a busy restaurant the later it gets in the evening, but I suppose I was still a bit surprised since it *was* a Friday night, and we were a good hour or so away from the kitchen closing (I checked with the waitress).

Even as busy as it was, we only had to wait at the bar for less than a drink's time.  We were seated upstairs, which was just as busy as the lower level (packed).  Since it was the first full night of vacation I was tempted to splurge on the Surf n' Turf, which is listed simply as ""Market"" price on the menu.  Thank God I asked - it was $52.00!  This surprised me, because the rest of the menu looked quite reasonable.  

We both went with the Sirloin and Shrimp, which was about $25 or so.  The food came out pretty quick.. maybe too quick, since you assume this is steak cooked to order (or you'd like to).  Unfortunately, when I bit into mine, it was pretty tough.  My girlfriend said she wasn't picky and she'd eat it, but then she too decided it was just too tough as well.  We had to send it back.  The shrimp came out on skewers and had a good charbroiled flavor to it, so no complaints on that.

While on vacation, have you ever wanted to feel like a local? Scott, the bartender, makes you feel warm and welcome while providing you great service. He was chatting with the patron next to us and when scott walked away, I asked the guy if he lived in Maui. He said, he'd been to Kimo's a few times , but the service makes everyone feel like a regular.

6/1/2010,5.0 star rating,"The restaurant opens at 5 and we had gotten here a little early so we went to the patio for drinks and an appetizer.  We had the calamari which was cooked perfectly, not chewy at all but instead tender and flavorful.  It's all strips so none of those leg things if you're squeamish about that.  I didn't have a drink but my friend said it was really good.  The view is awesome since the patio is right on the water but be warned that if you sit on the edge, you can get splashed a little.

Dinner was also amazing with great service and great food.  They start you off with bread and carrot muffins which might sound weird but are delicious. 

I had the prime rib which was maybe not the best I've had, but was definitely up there.  I ordered the smaller cut and it was already huge so I'd imagine that the bigger one is intended for either a voracious appetite or for sharing.  It came with mashed potatoes which were also pretty darn good.  My friend had the shrimp and steak which she really liked.  The shrimp has parmesan on it and is served over pilaf.  The steak was a decent size and had good flavoring as well.  

For dessert we had the hula pie which is as good as everyone says.  Macadamia nut ice cream with an oreo crust on the bottom, fudge and more macadamia nuts on top.  Delish!!

The view can't be beat, you're practically on top of the water!  Just watch your stuff if you're sitting by the railing because my friend accidently knocked her iPhone onto the patio roof and we had to have one of the waiters climb a wall to get it back for us while all of the tables around us watched.

This was supposed to be a special dinner for us during our stay on Maui.  It came highly recommended from some people and the yelp reviews seemed good.

We arrived later in the evening, so we got seated after a short wait.  The waitress took our drink orders then left.  She came back to take or food order then left.  She brought the soup and salad, then halfway through, our drinks arrived...  Finally!!!

Chowder was really good, until I got jabbed with a fish bone...  The waitress apologized and said she would take it off my bill.  (When I got the check, she didn't....)

I had the prime rib.  It was decent, but nothing compared to any decent steak house on the mainland.  My wife and daughter got the Ono, prepared ""Kimo's style"", and BOTH entrees were way overcooked.  Inedible.  

It was late, we were getting tired, so we asked for the check.

The brought us a free Hula Pie since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  The only really good thing was the Hula Pie. 5 stars!

We ordered the smoked marlin appetizer and it was indeed yummy. I had the fresh fish sandwich and my husband got the hamburger. Both were better than average. In fact, I'd say they also were yummy. The prices were very reasonable (we ordered off the bar menu).

1/2/2013,4.0 star rating,Best Mai Tai in Laihina and the mango piña colada is worth a try if you like sweeter drinks.

4/20/2013,4.0 star rating,"nice restaurant basically on top of the water (we sat at a table nearest the water and were literally feeling the spray off the ocean).

we came for dinner and the fish was delicious (we had 2 different entrees) and like others have said the carrot muffins were good.  prices were what we expected. (if you are looking for a cheap seafood restaurant on the water, you probably should not have come to maui.)

i thought the hula pie was overrated- basically its a really really large piece of ice cream cake/pie with lots of whipped cream. the ingredients are average (ice cream, cookie crust, whipped cream).",F K.,"Milwaukee, WI",4.0 star rating

bread -- sourdough roll and carrot muffin  =)

mushu kahlua pork -- kahlua pork that you wrap w/a flour tortilla 
                     w/sweet sauce and onions.
seafood cioppino -- enough seafood but cioppino tasted more like seafood with marinara sauce than a garlic broth
hula pie -- yes, we did try it after being already full.  it was HUGE -- it

We went to this restaurant by recommendation; we put our names in at the host station and were told we had about an hour and a half wait, so we went to the bar for a drink. The bartender told us that the section of tables near the bar were first come first serve, so we did a bit of stalking and got a table when another group left. 

The bar tables do not have access to the full dinner menu, but what they did have was delicious. Two people at the table got the fish sandwich and they made yummy-noises the whole time they ate :) After our meals, we ordered the Hula Pie, which was amazing as well.

10/16/2010,4.0 star rating,"If you're in Maui, you have to go to one of the restaurants owned by this group at least once, so we chose Kimo's since Leilani's and Hula Grill always seemed overpacked.  Definitely recommend making reservations, which we were able to do morning of, so you don't have to plan too far in advance.

Had the opakapaka Kimo style, which is in a basil butter sauce.  The fish was perfectly moist, and the sauce added great flavor.  Sis had the opakapaka w/ the parmesan crust, good but slightly milder and dry.

Service was very good, direct ocean-front view is outstanding for a sunset.  They are definitely overpriced, but worth it for at least one Maui meal.  For the same price, I'd go to Lahaina Grill where the food is a culinary adventure but lacks the view.

That Hula pie. 

But yes, their fish was fresh and well prepared as well. Servers were very helpful with any questions we had on their dishes. Awesome ambiance as well -- torches, waves crashing on the shore. We got there pretty late for dinner, so most people were leaving by the time we got our food, which really was nice since I'm sure it could get pretty noisy.

8/10/2014,1.0 star rating,"I'm extremely disappointed with what Kimo's has become.  This place used to rival Mama's in terms of quality of the food and experience, and the price was reasonable too.  You used to be able to order a variety of fresh fish, choose different methods of having it prepared, and select from the sides to accompany it.  Now, the menu is fixed.  Worse, the fish isn't prepared as well.  My wife complained hers was fishy and wet in the middle when we went recently.  In the five years in a row we've been going here, she's always praised the preparation.  Now, she swears she'll never go back.  And we weren't the only ones who found Kimo's has gone down hill.  Some friends of our who were in town the same time as us had the same complaints about the menu change and the experience lacking from what it used to be.  I'm afraid I have to agree with my wife.  We won't ever be going back.  So sad to see you nose dive, Kimo's.",Robert S.,"Huntington Beach, CA",4.0 star rating
6/17/2011,3.0 star rating,"Went here for dinner around sunset, and had a great view from upstairs.

I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Ono... the sauce had a delicious flavor, but the fish was a little to firm for me. It was the first time I tried ono, and I probably wont get it again. Its more steak like than I like my fish. Not flaky at all (but thats my fault for trying something new). The caesar salad that comes with the dinner was alright, and the rice pilaf that came with my fish was just okay. My meal left me feeling under whelmed.

The hubby got the steak and shrimp, which he said was good. Just good.

I was a bit surprised that they charge per refill on my lemonade. Cmon, its not an alcoholic beverage... why are you charging per refill? If I would have known that, I would have had the one, then stuck to water.

food- just ok, we had the sloppy joe and ribs. i'll give the food 3 stars just for being reasonably priced given the views and ambiance

I got a baked potato on the side and it was massive.  You should definitely share it with someone else.  Overall our entire party of 11 loved their food and there were plenty of take home bags that were consumed the next day for breakfast.  Although it's a chain, it's the best of the group to go to.

""Is this how we want to spend our food calories?""

But it's too late for second guessing. I'm hungry, cranky, and she is threatening to leave me for somebody more even keeled.

Fine!  I'll have the cobb salad, and she'll have the chicken teriyaki sandwich with fries.

Holy crap. One of the best cobbs ever!  I love when my cobb is all fresh and nicely chopped.  Perfect in fact--even the lettuce.  Her chicken was moist, tender and very flavorful.  The fries (and we are serious about our fries!!) came out luke warm...but a quick word to the waitress brought out a fresh batch of piping hot pommes with flavor to rival ANY I have had.

10/21/2013,1.0 star rating,"This is a LONG overdue review.

My husband made reservations here for the last night of our honeymoon and asked for a table along the balcony because we were celebrating and timed it to catch the sunset. 

We arrived in time for our reservation, and the hostess told us it would be a couple of minutes (with a healthy dose of attitude). 15-20 minutes later, she showed us to our table. The table was right outside the door to the kitchen, the furthest you could possibly be from the balcony, with zero view (unless you are wanting to watch your food being made).

Upset about this, but trying to salvage the experience, we ask if we can be seated at another table, since that was the request when the reservation was made and this is a very special evening. The hostess tells us that a ""premium reservation"" was needed to get the table we were hoping for. I let her know that I have never heard of such a thing and it was never mentioned to us when the reservation was made, and ask again that we get another table. She refuses. At that point we left, astonished by how the exchange had gone.

I ordered the Lobster filled Hapu'u, the Hawaiin Sea Bass. Every morsel I took, took me to culinary paradise (well, what a shame!! I was already in paradise). I tried my significant other's dish and it was really really good as well. I haven't tasted such good sea food in the bay area.

11/8/2010,3.0 star rating,"Kimo's was a good time, if a little underwhelming relative to expectations going in.  Our experience felt a tad bit... rushed.  Granted, we arrived at 5pm on a Friday night, but still:  the pace and rhythm of the meal was too hurried considering that we were there on vacation to enjoy a sunset as a family.

1. Server (I think his name was actually also Kimo...) was good.  He was attentive and had an impressive command of the menu.  That said, I am becoming vaguely suspicious of waiters' ability to accurately describe fish dishes.  ""Medium-firmness Flaky White Fish"" might as well be the de facto description of every plate I've heard described in my 3 days here. But I digress.

2. For a place that prizes its sunset view, I think they could stand to figure our a superior system for managing the sunlight-in-the-eyes problem.  My whole family was squinting heavily throughout dinner, and this was with sunglasses ON! Again, not a deal killer, just vaguely added to the less-than-relaxing vibe when paired with the pace issues mentioned above.

3. The food was... fine.  My Caesar salad was nice... My Kimo's style Mahi Mahi was adequate but a little on the small side.  My wife had the seared ahi, and was happy.  Mom had the shrimp something or other.  And was also ""fine"". 

4. The price struck me as a high for what we got.  Yes it was Maui, but Ferraro's at The Four Seasons (see my review) was only incrementally more expensive and substantially better food quality, quantity and ambiance.",Mike B.,"Naperville, IL",4.0 star rating

Wow! We had heard that this was the place to go for the best (and freshest) fish on the island. On our last day before heading out to the airport we decided to come here. The parking lot was packed. The free valet parking was a plus. (of course we tipped anyway). We didn't make reservations which might of helped but we were seated in 15 minutes. Pictures of famous celebs are posted near the entance way. The wait staff are very friendly and helpful. We told our waiter Tim that we had a plane to catch so he was great in pushing our order through. I had the Kamachi, My wife had the Ono, and another friend had the Sashimi! All dishes (while very pricey) were really good and a treat we entitled ourselves to. I am told that their fishermen catch fish for the restaurant daily so you can be sure to have the freshest s

He was very attentive, explained the flavors/taste of anything we weren't familiar with and over all had a very cheerful and welcoming personality.  We came around 6 and had no problem getting a seat for their dinner service on their upper patio over looking the ocean. I ended up with the ginger orange glazed Ono and my husband got the Mahi Mahi. Both meals were tasty but not more so than other meals we experienced on Maui for a portion of the cost. 

Tip from our happy hour experience: don't pay extra for the Kimo's coconut cup, they are made in China. When we asked the server about it she made a fuss about how they were local, like it was a personal attack.

8/22/2010,4.0 star rating,"This is what I love about Yelp: steering me to places I might have otherwise overlooked.

There's not much from the street that indicates what awaits in Kimo's.  It looks much like any of the other restaurants on Front Street, many of which are just tourist joints and are not particularly good.

We arrived around 11:30 a.m. (I always try to beat the lunch crowds by about 15 minutes) and were allowed to pick our own table.  We took one right by the railing overlooking the ocean.  The million dollar view and ocean sounds added a full star to my overall rating.

The service was very good and right in line with virtually all of the service we received in Maui: friendly, efficient, un-hurried.

Our food was tasty and the portions were just right; they weren't huge, but I don't like to cart around left-overs while I'm on vacation, so having enough to fill us up without leaving extra was actually a plus.

I ordered the special, which was a tuna salad sandwich.  I almost never order tuna salad because it tends to have the taste, texture and appearance of lumpy wallpaper paste (and not even good wallpaper paste).  I was told that this was made with sashimi-grade ahi that was caught this morning... and, after eating it, I believed them.  Best tuna salad I've ever had.

Much of the rest of the menu is standard pub grub fare, with an emphasis on fresh fish (naturally).  Not terribly exiting, but seemed to be adequately executed.

The best thing on the menu is the Hula Pie, for which Kimo's is apparently well known.  It's a Hawaiian take on a mud pie, and was terrific.  The toasted macadamia nuts on it were fantastic.  The piece was huge, and was easily shared by the three of us.

Kimo's is not the the Hai'imaile General Store, but it isn't trying to be.  It a nice place to go on Front Street with jaw-dropping views and a killer dessert.",Michael C.,"Livermore, CA",4.0 star rating

We got in just in time for happy hour to try their famous hula pie.  Before we ordered it,  we snacked on the mu shu pork appetizer.  It was much better then we thought it was going to be. That dish ended up giving us one of the tastiest kalua pork we had during our trip to maui. The dish was accompanied with a tangy sauce and wrappers that we had enjoyed very much. After finishing the wraps we ordered the pie and we were shocked by the size of it.  Surprisingly we conquered the pie. That massive beast was a a lot of fun to eat.  It also gave as a new found love of macadamia nut ice cream that was placed on top of a thick layer of Oreo crust. It felt like the hula pie was a treat that kept giving.

Of course you need to have the Hula Pie - over the top serving, macadamia ice cream and plenty of fudge - one slice is good for 6 people.

5/8/2011,5.0 star rating,"We read some of the other reviews and only tentatively decided to try it out.  And we're both really glad we did!  I'd recommend it for anyone.

The location is awe-inspiring and the restaurant does a good job of taking advantage of either top deck or bottom for table views.  We sat up top based on recommendations from other yelpers but I don't think it would have mattered that much.  The view to the ocean is everything that we came to Maui for.

Generous portions, good food (not 5 star good food but really good).  Starting with just the warm bread and carrot muffins they bring --- delicious.  We had mu shu pork appetizer which was both good and a generous portion followed by the mahi mahi Kimo's style.  That was fantastic.  The hula pie is a monster that, if you're an ice cream lover, you can't miss out - so my wife says.

The service was phenomenal. This was on par with the best service we've had at any top restaurant.  The hostesses were all very nice and our server was extremely attentive.  My wife and I shared a plate and I had asked a question about ingredients in an appetizer since I cannot stomach lactose.

I might go back for a drink the wedge salad and the pie on a special occasion...But not a meal.  Fish was fresh but sauce was salty. Prime rib and Vegis were cold upon arrival. Neither flavorful.

11/8/2012,4.0 star rating,"We had reservations at 8 on a Monday evening. We arrived 15 mins early and we were seated right away. Good thing we had reservations as it seemed they there were quite a few people waiting to be seated. We were seated in the lower deck overlooking the ocean. Ambience was great with live music, light guitar and vocals (nothing obnoxiously loud like Cheesburger down the street). 

Service was a little slower but that could have been because of the amount of people there. Also, there was apparently a whole set of wait-staff dedicated entirely to drinks who kept circling around and we repeatedly had to tell them no. A bit overdone on their part. 

We ordered the mahi-mahi ""Kimo style"" and the ""smaller"" portion of the prime rib. Both were served with a Caesar salad and a warm basket of bread. Both entrees were great. Prime rib was oddly excessively salty on the bites towards the edge-- probably attributed to some kind of brining process in them getting the meat so tender.

11/21/2009,4.0 star rating,"Picture this:

It's your birthday and you're in Maui. You're on your way to dinner where you're meeting up with several of your college friends for your special day. You're in the car with your husband and some friends are in the back seat taking a nap. You approach an intersection and the light turns red. You stop... but the car behind you somehow missed the ball and rams into your trunk. The trunk of your rental car. You get out to talk to the girl and she's already in tears. She calls her friend who's good with cars and he comes by and helps out with the situation. No hard feelings, but kiiiiinda sucks to happen on your birthday and in a car that's not yours. 

Somehow, you get by. You and your car-mates are startled, but you finish your drive. You arrive at dinner at Kimo's and sit at a table of 11 people. You start perusing the menu when one of the ladies from the bar walks by. 

She looks really familiar. 

Oh, that's right. SHE JUST REAR-ENDED YOU. And who turns out to be your waiter? HER FRIEND THAT CAME TO HELP HER. 

How did this happen to us? Of all people to be hit by in Maui, of all restaurants to go to, and of all tables to be sat at, we ended up re-uniting with our friend's hit-and-stay-but-kinda-freak-out frenemy.

She was so apologetic throughout the night and our waiter was extremely nice to us. She came over to our table at the beginning and apologized to our friend and the whole table and insisted that desert was on her. 

(Our bastardly selfish question: just for the birthday girl or everyone? Turned out everyone. Amazing)

The meal itself was pretty yummy. Lots of seafood and steak but not much else. I ordered one of the fish specials which was a Chipotle-flavored Mahi-Mahi with rice pilaf and a spicy pineapple salsa. 

It's probably because I was in the birthplace of pineapples (which grow underground if you didn't know), but JESUS OH LORDY LORD the salsa was everything I hoped and dreamed. 

The prices are a little on the higher side and good for things like birthday dinners, last night in Hawaii meals, or where you take your hooker when you try to Pretty Woman her/him. Just don't let them go shopping with your credit card on the main drag in Lahaina.

We actually were in the third row away from the balcony so our view still wasn't bad (1st and 2nd rows from balcony is preferred seating) and it was dark anyways. We could still hear the waves crashing though which was kinda cool. 
For dinner, I ordered the Koloa pork ribs and polynesian chicken which came with rice, ceasar salad, and bread and carrot muffins (we almost didnt get this though since the waiter nearly forgot to bring it). The husband ordered the teriyaki steak with mashed potatoes and all the accompaniments as well. The ceasar salads and regular bread were mediocre. The carrot muffins on the other hand were fabulous! I wish they had just served more of these. Now onto our actual meal. The portions were a bit small for the price but the hubby said his steak was excellent, cooked to perfection and the teriyaki sauce was delicious. My ribs and chicken, on the other hand, left me underwhelmed. The ribs were not fall off the bone tender and juicy but I will say that the sauce was decent. The chicken was a bit dry and overcooked. Additionally, the chicken didn't have enough sauce on it. All in all, not wowed... until we received our free hula pie that is (had a coupon). I had read so many positive reviews on this pie and after trying it, I can honestly say that this pie lives up to every bit of the hype. Before the pie came out, the hubby didn't think he would like it and expressed that he does not like to just sit there and eat ice cream. However, he loved the macadamia nut ice cream in this pie so much that he couldn't stop eating it.
For anyone visiting Maui, I would say that Kimo's is a cool place to eat at but don't expect to be impressed by most of the food. Looking back, I wish we had gone during lunch when we could actually see the water and the food would have been cheaper. One thing is for sure though... you must try the hula pie! It is to die for!

A sidenote: The coupon for the free hula pie can be found at a few places around town. We got ours from one of those little timeshare places where they try to get you to attend a hotel tour in order to get cheaper attractions. We didn't do the tour but we did walk away with the coupon at least! There you go! Free hula pie!",Jennifer G.,"Pinal, AZ",4.0 star rating

The overpriced menu and quality of food/drink was not up to par. Decided to do appetizers and drinks for sunset and started with two pina coladas that were absent of alcohol and flavor. Ordered another cranberry mixed cocktail for the esposa that was better. Went with the sushimi, pork ribs, and grilled veggie plate and was disappointed with the lack of flavor in all except for the ribs. 
Our waitress was on the ball and fantastic the whole time. She even deleted one pina from our bill. All said, we found it a tourist trap in a touristy town so that wasn't a complete shocker...

4/18/2014,2.0 star rating,"If you enjoy eating food with bugs, this place is for you. So disgusted. I don't mind bugs that are flying, especially since we're outside. Bugs are to be expected. Upon being seated, we were given water and there was a beetle-like bug on my glass (super tiny but I could definitely see it). I thought that wasn't too bad until I saw about 5 more. One crawled onto my plate, there were two crawling on the table, one on my napkin and one in my boyfriends plate, who after seeing it says, ""oh wow I see what you mean"".  At first he thought I was exaggerating because again, we were on the patio and flies are to be expected. But these little creatures do not fly and if you're not careful, they may go unnoticed into your mouth. They are brown so they blend in with the table. Most people probably don't even notice but we definitely did. I gave 3 stars because the food was delicious (mashed potatoes came out cold though) and the service is great. Very nice and friendly.

Salad: Very good ceaser salad. My brother traded for the clam chowder, which was pretty thin.

Dinner: Excellent! I had the opah kimo style, although it couldn't compare with my moms coconut crusted sword fish -- a must get!

Service: Great service, water glasses always full, very friendly helpful waiters, except for the fact they over charged us when we used a visa gift card and we didn't realize till the next day.

Dessert: Everyone on Yelp raved about the Hula pie so we got it. I was not impressed. It was just a large scoop of ice cream shaped as a pie with whipped cream. Where were all the macadamia nuts. NOT worth the novelty.

View: We were in the ""second row"" and had a beautiful view of the ocean, and the sunset.

Price: Consider a 30-40 dollar plate of sea food or meat. Although remember you get a salad. No a la cart. :-) Good price for Maui and for fresh sea food.

3/4/2010,3.0 star rating,"The choices of restaurants on Front Street is overwhelming. It seems like the numerous tourists were evenly distributed in each restaurant, so it was hard to tell which one to try. We quickly looked up yelp reviews and Kimo seems to be well liked. 

Understandably packed on a weekend night, the restaurant told us to wait about 25 minutes. There is a bar area downstairs where people can stand around, enjoy a drink while waiting to be paged. 

We were brought upstairs and the place looked pretty colonial. We sat in the middle of the restaurant, so we had to look through two rows of tables before eyeing the waterfront. 

All the entrees came with a caesar salad and sour dough rolls and carrot breads. The salad was fresh and delicious. Sour dough rolls were great as well. I didn't care for the carrot bread too much. It was like a mini-muffin. 

I ordered the pork ribs and Polynesian chicken. Ribs were slathered with a thick sweet BBQ sauce. Meat was tender and flavorful. The chicken was really boring, a bit over cooked. 

My husband had the beef and the chicken, which looked alright to me. 

Portions weren't as huge as I had expected, but I did take a small doggie bag home with me. And by doggie bag, I really mean a bag with all kinds of words and pictures indicating that it truly is for your doggie at home. Kinda funny since most restaurants nowadays have plain bags for you to take your leftover home. In fact, I haven't heard the word doggie bag in about 10 years. 

We didn't have room for dessert since we ate so late. And I am glad we didn't. Seeing how large a piece of Hula pie is nearly blocked my arteries just by looking at it.

To start we shared the kula pork lettuce wraps which where a nice sweet salty pulled pork with onion a plum sauce on butter lettuce very nice and flavor was right on. For mains I had the fresh fish which was Mong chong fish with salad It was dry and not cooked well with little flavor I would not suggest it.

My opah was very tasty and very firm, but not as moist I had hoped.  My husband's ciopinno was watery and soupy.  He prefers a more thicker, almost marinara like consistency, but he enjoyed the flavor of the broth.  He did complain that some of his pieces of fish did not taste fresh.

And of course, I have to have my staple libation of choice . .  you guessed correctly . . . Tropical Itch!

Then our entrees, which were both fish and very, very well prepared.  I had told our server that it was our 10th anniversary and she brought us a HUGE slice of ice cream pie.  It was a fantastic way to end a fantastic meal!!  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this place.  The atmosphere was remarkable and our seats overlooked the ocean.

8/12/2011,2.0 star rating,"Man, this was a fail!
Tried to have dinner with friends and ""catch up"". We've been here before and the service was fine, we came with our kids last time. Service came often to fill water and ask how is everything, that was OK then.
This time we were here with adults and we all wanted to have a good time and talk and laugh.  The waiters kept interupting our converseation! Waiters are supposed to be stealthy. These waiters were far from it, they actually interupted our conversation to ask if we wanted more water. What is that? ...Please, just fill without asking.
The food: it was bland and not tasty at all. We all tried to fix it with sauces, but to no avail. Two of the meals were only nibbled becacuse, even at $38 a plate, they were kina yucky and not worth eating.
One of us had the filet minon and it was OK to eat.
And the food that remained on our plates, they just took it away without asking if there was something wrong with it or asking if we wanted to take it. Then they actually took our alcoholic beverages (half full) from the table... that's when they were stealthy. I'm not sure why that happened. Why would bussboys take half full glasses from patrons ($8 each), two of them. The bill for this $$ place was $350 for 8 (entrees only), no appetisers and no desserts and only 4 drinks. No the prices aren't an affordable $$, for most families. I guess its a deal for Kaanapali though??? If the food and service were better!!
The story ended this way, they cleared everything from our table, even our napkins by 10PM. Wow, that's early.  There were other couples in the restaurant, we were far from last, but they were pushing us all out the door as non-subtley as possible. 
I'm not enjoying th""push"" to leave. I come and spend money for dinner on Hawaii to relax and enjoy my time, not to be pushed out by these waiters and bussboys.

They sat us immediately and gave us plenty of room for a high-chair and one stroller.  View from upstairs was great at sunset, but we sat a couple rows of tables back from the rail.  

Service was very friendly, but somewhat pushy to take your order and turn the table.  We learned that this was customary pretty much everywhere, so they don't really get points off for that.  

The food was fine, if unspectacular.  Prices were pretty normal for the area.  I had the seared ahi which the waitress talked up about being sashimi grade.  It was good but was more seared than I would have liked, so that was a bummer.  Everything was very good though, we had no complaints on the food.",Johnny M.,"Austin, TX",4.0 star rating

7/22/2009,3.0 star rating,"This joint gets a 3.5 or so actually.  It's not that I don't enjoy it, it's just that this place is meant to be a tourist trap and being a local most my life I know what to expect.  All the tourists are told 'Eat at Kimo's'.  

Kimo's is located in Lahaina on Front St. in a great location overlooking the ocean.  The place serves lunch and dinner, and lots of folks come to enjoy a meal with the Maui sunset (beautiful I tell you).  Kimo's is owned and operated by TS Restarurants, the same owners of other tourist-oriented eateries like Hula Grill and Duke's.  So you will notice the menus to be somewhat similar.

The food at Kimo's is familiar and mostly in the safe zone for tourist types who don't know Hawaii cuisine very well.  I prefer to dine at Kimo's for lunch and sit on the 'Lanai' so I can take in a bit of sun with my meal.  Their lunch menu isn't very large but they have a good selection of pupus (appetizers), sandwiches, salads, and entrees.  Their Wo Hing Salad ($7.95) has fresh Maui grown greens, roasted peanuts, wontons, and sesame dressing is great.  You can add a teriyaki chicken breast ($11.95) or fresh grilled fish ($12.95) to your salad to make it a meal.  Me, I usually opt for the Black Angus Cheeseburger ($9.95) which is a 1/2 pound of beef with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and Maui onion on an onion bun.  Their sandwiches and burgers all come with Maui chips.  This burger tastes great after a day of walking on Front St. in the Maui sun and you're hungry and ready to cool down for a bit.

Kimo's also does a lot of fish for the lunch menu, some of their popular ones are the Fish Tacos ($11.95), Beer Battered Fish N' Chips ($12.95), and the Front St. Fish Sandwich ($12.95).  All fish here is locally caught in Hawaii and should always be fresh.  If it's not, do send it back!

I don't generally come to Kimo's for dinner so I will refrain from trying to review the menu, but they do have many various fish entrees and prime steaks at night.  But if I do come here at night it is always for a nightcap and some dessert.  In particular, the dessert Kimo's is famous for...The Original Hula Pie ($6.95)!  I for some reason cannot go to Kimo's for lunch or stop by at night and not have a slice of this heavenly pie.  It's got a cookie crust and is stuffed with macadamia nut ice cream, and topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and more nuts!  The slice is HUGE and can easily feed 2-3 people.  One of the best ways to finish lunch or a breezy night on Maui.",Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating

They have delicious bread! yummy!! Their house caesar salad was really good! Everyone was very happy with their dinners! We all had something different too, fish, chicken, steak, etc. GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!

Great location right on the Front St strip in Lahaina, with most of their tables having a great view of the water.  Worth getting there before the sun finishes going down.  Parking can be tough, but you can park anywhere along the strip and walk easily to Kimo's.

9/7/2009,2.0 star rating,"This place is a CLASSIC tourist trap (it was late and we were starving for dinner), as one would expect when you go into a restaurant located on Front Street in Lahaina.  Portions are SMALL and prices are exorbitant!  I guess we were somewhat naive to believe that seafood/fish entrees would be reasonably priced considering we were on a tropical island of all places, but nope, it was not the case at all.  A single thin filet of any of the fishes on the menu and a single scoop of rice with a few strands of green beans or asparagus was $30+!  Steaks were similarly priced, but again, they were small servings.  Food quality was subpar to average (probably equivalant to a Legal Seafood or McCormick and Schmick-level of quality)  especially for the price.  A little ridiculous, but again, tourist trap pricing. 

The hula pie dessert was amazing though.  It was about $8 for a HUGE chunk of ice cream cake with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, etc.  That may be the only thing worthwhile.  

We went there for dinner, so can't really say anything about the view at all, but the place sure was busy and service was really slow.  Would we go back again. . . resounding NO!",Melvin B.,"Gaithersburg, MD",4.0 star rating

The view is nice enough (although you could get the exact same view from any of the waterfront restaurants on Front Street), the service was fine and I appreciate that they offer varieties of fish that aren't available everywhere.  If I could I would probably give this place 2.5 stars (3 stars for my nairagi and 2 stars for my mom's monchong), but I'm rounding down to 2 stars.",Victoria B.,"New York, NY",4.0 star rating

The last time I was there, I had the ahi which was seared perfectly. The Hula Pie is HUGE. Your entire party can probably eat one, and it's really great.

2/2/2011,5.0 star rating,This place is a must if your in Laihaina.  The view is amazing during sunset.  The Hula pie is the best dessert ever.   I think we ate a hula pie every night when we were in Maui.  The hula pie can be share with a couple of other people.  We ordered one hula for four people and that was perfect.  Its sooooooo good.  My wife and I shared the Prime Rib 32 oz. that is perfect.  The portion is pretty big.  That is the perfect size rime rib for two people.  Even if your hungry.  Trust me it will be hard to finish it all by yourself.  The perfect meal here is a prime rib and hula pie for dinner... Life can not get better then that.

My wine was served in a glass with lipstick marks still on it. Forgiveable, of course, until the bartender just poured the wine into a different glass with an annoyed look on her face. Then the food arrives, and the fish and chips are not cooked all the way through (batter is mushy) and the ""island fish"" is bland and overcooked.

As we were leaving, I heard a woman at another table look down at her plate and say, ""Oh no, I'm going to have to send this back and get something else.""

Parking was a pain, but best if you have the valet down the street park for you. MUCH better than the $10 public parking lots. The valet is no charge - just whatever you think it's worth for tip (we still gave him $10...).

Our server was ok - but it was super busy that night so his seeming ""inattentiveness"" was due to his workload. The cocktail waitress was also a little slow getting to our table, but also for the same reason. We had reservations and still had to wait for a table - a little bit of a drag.

Our experience was a solid 4 stars out of 5 and we would definitely go back - just probably earlier and wait for a table on the first level in front of the ocean. Order a fish dish and you won't be disappointed. :-)",Tammi S.,"Pleasanton, CA",4.0 star rating

Why do my family and I seem to always come here though we have all agreed upon the fact that we absolutely abhor this place , think the food is mediocre and overpriced every single time? I don't really know. I mean Kimo's is great the first time you go with its spectacular views and great location in Lahina, but there are just so many better restaurants on the island.

Even though my family eats steak  we always end up getting a fish ""Kimo's Style"" or  the Koloa Pork Ribs and try one random thing new on the menu.... but seriously, we never get to excited about what we order....

My little sister likes the Hula Pie and I have to agree that it is pretty good, but if I was paying I wouldn't go to Kimo's. There are so many better restaurants and if a view is what your looking for then get take out from somewhere and go sit on a beach.

A tourist joint it is, like every restaurant I went to on Maui, but they actually make some good food at a very reasonable price.

Firstly, let me touch on the fact they they make the best Mai Tai on the island. Well, I can't really say that, but it was the best that I tasted. Strong, with just the right amount of panty-removing sweetness. Giggidy!

I had the herbed marlin fillet. This was the first time I had marlin, and I can say I like the fish much better than the baseball team (which I don't like at all). It was good. They also did a really good job cooking the steamed rice...I dunno, it was just great.

Could you go here and not get the Hula Pie? Not if you're a red-blooded American like myself. Honestly, it was simply vanilla iced cream frozen to 0 degrees kelvin, with an Oreo crust and Hershey's chocolate-flavored syrup. Not horribly exciting but big enough for 4 people to share.

I had the cheeseburger, which was a nice piece of meat, and the ingredients were fresh.  Very tasty!  My husband got the Broke da Mouth plate, and he scarfed it down like a madman and wanted more.

Service was pretty awful, they got drinks wrong and the waitress we had was not very knowlageable about their menu, not to mention forgot to bring a plate out completely. Drinks were left empty and overall a very unfriendly staff member with slow service. The atmosphere is nice and the ocean is right next to you. Their fish tacos wherever mediocre, fish dry and not enough everything else, but it had potential. For dessert we had the hula pie, which was enormous. It was quite good and very tasty, and without this pie I would have rated this restaurant a 2.",Katie A.,"Charlotte, NC",4.0 star rating
2/13/2011,2.0 star rating,"We visited Kimo's for lunch. Sitting outside near the water was nice, our take on the food (and drinks) confirms the ""tourist trap"" rating unfortunately (we should have guessed, given the location and that this is a chain).

We came to eat good fresh fish. ""FRESH ISLAND FISH"" and ""COCONUT CRUSTED FRESH ISLAND FISH"" both looked good on paper and turned out flops. The actual dishes rather appeared unsuccessful attempts of compensating for non-fresh/tasty fish with fancy workarounds. Also, though mentioned on the menu, the macaroni salad did not really fit with anything in the dish. The server recommended  cocktail turned out to be a watery version of what we had imagined. Overall, disappointing and there are much better places to have good food and especially good fish on Maui (try Paia Fish Market or Eskimo Candy, for example).",Tim W.,"South San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
6/11/2009,3.0 star rating,"Went on week of 6/1/09, I'm giving 3 stars bc the View alone is worth 4. The food @ lunch is worth 2 stars! We had cheesebugers, which were dry, no flavor, overcooked! My mango colada was good though. We only went here bc aloha mixed plate was hella far to walk to with our 18mo, plus kimo got an ONO from Maui Revealed!

12/7/2008,2.0 star rating,"Alright, i have waited a while to write this review because I felt it best not to write a review while I was still ticked by the experience I had there. With that said, because of this Kimo's gets 2 stars from me now.

I have to say that this review is based on the most recent experience I had while in Maui.  I have been to Kimo's quite a few times in the past, probably 6 visits in the last 5 years. And to be fair, I had never had a bad time or bad service before. However after this last time, I will never go back.

The food is good. Not spectacular and definitely food you can find in other restaurants around, so don't feel like you will be missing something you couldn't get elsewhere.  I would recommend the Hula Grill or Lei Lani's for food within the price and quality range.

The service at Kimo's is why I will never return.  When we travel to Maui, we are usually traveling as an entire family, 20 plus people. On our family vacations,  we have a family dinner at Kimo's. 

Now I'm not sure why, but the reservations system at Kimo's is unlike any other I have ever seen.  Our reservation for 715pm was within a window of 30-45 minutes, meaning we arrived at 710 for our 715 reservation and were told we would be seated by 730-800pm, and to enjoy our time in the bar. 

We would have been fine with that but the whole thing goes down hill from there.  Without having to write a lengthier review, the hostesses are young and inexperienced, and the manager is a pretentious and condescending man whose lack of experience with customer service shows in the rest of the staff.  

I will not miss Kimo's the next time I am in Maui.",Anna T.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

It was my mission to have Hula Pie before we left Hawaii. I thought they'd be mean since we just came to order dessert, but she was really nice and came back to refill our waters even.

The service was exceptional, if a little slow, but with the fantastic Maui sunset we were glad we weren't rushed. The sirloin was a bit tough, and the swordfish was a little on the dry side.

9/28/2008,3.0 star rating,"The food was only a couple stars at best, but since this is Maui, they get a bonus star for the view.

During lunch time, it seems that only the lower outdoor patio is open, which may make it a little trickier to get a primo table but it worked out for us. We were right up against the edge and so close to the water that we kept getting spritzed by the waves breaking against the cement right next to us. Add a gorgeous day and a fruity boozy drink and you've got an idyllic afternoon.

I ordered the fish taco ($12) and it was not very good.  The fish was bland, and the sweet/savory combination of the ""tropical"" pineapple salsa and the shredded cheese just did not work.  At least the Caesar salad was edible. My friend got the coconut crusted fish,  which seemed fine if not that memorable.

The hula pie ($7) is ok, though the macadamia nut ice cream is frozen solid so you either need a chisel or a lot of patience to eat it.",Becky S.,"North Hollywood, CA",4.0 star rating

This time the wait was short, but would recommend getting a reservation.  Great wait staff, food, reasonable prices, and the excellent view from almost every table. The restaurant is upstairs and open to the ocean side, the lounge is downstairs and features live local music that is also open to the ocean side and makes waiting for a table enjoyable. Suggestions: when you order an entree, add the Lobster Tail for only $14.95 and the Hula Pie for dessert both were excellent.

8/30/2010,2.0 star rating,From the appearance and water front view you would expect the food to be better. This was very over priced diner food. The fish was not cooked properly and their local fresh fish was very limited. The salad that came with my lunch meal had brown romaine spines so it was not fresh. Our service was also unusually slow. A table that was seated about 10 minutes later than us were served their food at least 10 minutes before our order. We did not order anything that would require a long cook time but we waited a good 20+ minutes for our food. Something may have just gone awry with our order but nothing was ever said. For the price I would head up to Kaanapali in Whaler's Village and experience the opposite end of the spectrum at Leilani's. http://www.yelp.com/biz/leilanis-on-the-beach-lahaina,Gwen N.,"Bellevue, WA",4.0 star rating

The only thing grilled on the menu was the seared ahi.  I ordered it and it arrived cold. The service was touch-and-go too.  Waaayyy over-priced! A real tourist trap.  The only redeeming thing was the Hula pie. Very yummy.  You can find coupons for free pie all over Lahaina but the catch is, you have to buy two over-priced entrees to get it.  Go here if you are stuck on a date with someone you don't have much to say to but want to impress with your loose wallet.",T S.,"Palm Springs, CA",4.0 star rating
8/4/2009,4.0 star rating,"Well we get here and was told that the wait would be an hour and 15 minutes for dinner.  But luckily a party came in and cancelled and brought our wait to only 20 minutes.  We get seated as pretty close to the railing of the ocean front.  We had a party of 5 and from what it seems like only couples/2 people can sit on the railing.  The view is absolutely beautiful and weather was damn near perfect.  The ambiance was perfect.  

We are greeted by our waiter and then goes onto his spiel about the menu.  I'd say overall he was very attentive to our needs.  Always filling our water and just asking in general how was everything.  Just what I expect out of my waiter/waitress. 

We then get fresh bread and a carrot muffin.  The carrot muffin was delicious.  The bread was very hot and soft served with butter.  The carrot muffin I'd go back for.  Too bad they didn't serve seconds, haha.  My mom also ordered a Pina Colada.  We got it and it was very watery.  Much more than were were accustomed too.  It wasn't tasty at all.  We also ordered cocktail shrimp and it was typical cocktail shrimp.  Nothing special here.  

I ordered the swordfish topped with coconut crust, salsa and peanut sauce.  It was okay and nothing too special in my opinion.  fish was kind of bland but the sauce made up for it in flavor.  For $30 I was hoping for a bit more.

My sister and mom ordered the cioppino.  They said it was okay and the one in SF was much better.  Brother ordered the polynesian chicken and he said it was good.  Dad ordered the shrimp tahitini or whatever and he said it was delicious.   

Now onto the Hula Pie.  We walking around Front St. and landed next to a Tours store right next to the Cookie store and Ice cream store.  In this tour store they had cards where you were able to get a free hula pie with a purchase of two entrees.  We grabbed two cards.  Since we had 4 entrees, we got two free Hula Pies.  These things are no joke.  It's huge.  As many have said, it can easily satisfy 4 people.  But might as well get the 2 hula pies.  I wouldn't say it's to die for but it's very good.  It's vanilla ice cream tops with peanuts and hot fudge and it has an Oreo cookie as the crust.  Like I said it's huge.   But my Dad is a big ice cream eater so he basically finished off one hula pie on his own while me, my sister and mom ate 3/4 of the pie.  All in all, I'd recommend the Hula Pie.  

3 stars for food and 5 stars for service and ambiance.  I might skip it if you are into really good food as in my opinion this place is okay for food for the price.  Our bill came out to be $120.

2/3/2009,2.0 star rating,"I wasn't impressed with this place either and it was recommended by our resort host as a must try.  First we were told that we needed to wait 10 minutes for our table and so we thought we'd have time to get our parking ticket validated in the meantime.  Just two buildings down, our buzzer started beeping.  That was a quick 10 minutes!  We had continued to get our ticket validated and returned to the restaurant at which point, the hostess told us that it will be another 10 minutes so thought I could use the restroom during the wait time.  When I got out of the restroom some 2 minutes later, my friend told me that they were going to seat us but since I wasn't there we had to wait longer.  Eventually we got seated.  

Strike 1:  I had requested that I have balsamic vinagrette on my salad instead of their usual caesar dressing but I didn't get what I had ordered. The waiter immediately replaced it.  

Strike 2:  I had ordered one of their specials - leilani snapper only to be told later on that they didn't have any left so I resorted to the the A'hu prepared any way I wanted since I wasn't getting what I originally ordered.  I chose the orange-ginger glaze preparation.  My friend, ordered the coconut/macadamia nut a'hu prep which was offered that night as part of the regular menu.  

Strike 3:  When we received our entrees, my friend insisted that they switched our plates since she couldn't taste the coconut on hers and the brown sauce was too spicy.  We switched but by the end of dinner we realized that the waiter did get it right the first time.  I ended up having the spicy coconut/macadamia a'hu.  I didn't eat my fish since it was way too spicy for my palette even after trying to remove the sauce.  At that point I was too tired to request for a different entree.  

Three strikes and I'm out of there!  I understand the strikes may not have been in the waiters control but this experience didn't make for a good first impression.  At least our waiter removed one of the fish entrees from our bill...",Noreen M.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating

My boyfriend got a fish.. spacing on the name but it was something our waitress recommeneded and he enjoyed it.

While their surf and turf options look nice, there were no veggie options on the menu.

9/18/2008,3.0 star rating,"The six of us arrived a tad late but they were gracious enough to seat us upstairs, facing the beach. Even though the sun already set, it was nice to sit outside because the weather was perfect. 

When I opened the menu, I was a bit surprised to see what seemed like a lack of selection for such a huge restaurant. Then I started going through the menu and decided that Kimo's was probably trying to go for quality and not quantity. The server came out and told us the specials and seemed to answer our questions well. Then another server came out to take our drink orders. This separation was a bit strange to me because I've never been to a restaurant in which I had so many servers.

We ordered our meals and the drinks came out. Several of us ordered Lava Flows, a pina colada, a local beer, soda, and water. The drinks seemed a bit skimpy on the alcohol. However, yet another server did a good job of ensuring our water glasses were always filled.

Our meals began to come out:
-Caesar salad and Fisherman's Chowder
-Seafood Cioppino
-Mu Shu Kahlua Pork
-Lobster Filled Ono
-Parmesan Crusted Opah
-Koloah Pork Ribs

My Caesar Salad was perfect but the Fisherman's Chowder was clearly bottom of the pot. It was extra think and consisted of a lot of potatoes. My friends respectively liked their Lobster filled Ono and Koloah Pork Ribs. However, everything else was nothing to write home about.

I convinced everyone to order the Hula Pie for dessert. This was probably the best choice of the evening because everyone loved the dessert. 

The prices are okay for what you get. I do agree with another yelper's comments that the service is kind of rushed, but then again we got there kind of late (though other people arrived later than us).  I also noticed that there were no vegetarian entree options. 

What would make this place perfect is to have dedicated servers at each table instead of multiple people coming back and forth; more small plate options, and stronger drinks. Otherwise, I'd come back again if the suggestion was made.",Dawn L.,"Millbrae, CA",4.0 star rating

We were miss-lead to believe they had great burgers...told to make a reservation... told it was worth the wait. 
The reservation was for the upstairs dining,, which was just an expensive version of the down stairs pu-pu platter with some fancy fish dishes. 
All in all, I love Maui and there are some amazing eats there, but I'd go to Kimo's for happy hour, the view & the drinks... 
Oh and BTW turns out it's a chain... same owners & similar menu to Lelanies, Hula Grill, & Dukes.

We were surprised they were pretty good. The burger sliders were also nice.

I had the seared tuna for dinner which was covered with sweet chili sauce.  While the fish was cooked ok, the sauce tasted more like salad dressing.  I was not impressed with the taste, nor with the value for my money.
We tried the ""famous"" Hula Pie.  Basically, it is just vanilla ice cream with chopped macadamia nuts covered with fudge.  Meh.

I had sword fish with coconut crust and it was the best meal I had that whole week. Then we had been given a coupon for a free dessert from some lady in a store before we got to the restaurant so we thought we'd see what it was... not expecting much. ALOHA... a slice of Hula pie!

5/19/2013,1.0 star rating,"Kimo's was by far the worst of the nine restaurants at which we ate during our recent stay on Maui.
We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table although we had a reservation on a week night but that wasn't too troubling.  However, then we were taken up to our table but it wasn't ready so we had to stand around with waiters and waitresses bustling around us until the table was set.  Very unprofessional.  
Once our drink order was taken, we had to wait a long time to get it.  When we did, we discovered they were weak for the price.
However, the biggest issue was that our entrees tasted like they had been frozen and then reheated in a microwave.  The fish was soggy and didn't taste particularly fresh.  The vegetables were watery.   
We considered asking for new entrees but we figured they wouldn't be any better (and then we would have had to spend more time next to a table of  eight loud, rambunctious children who were being ignored by their parents who were at an another table).  
We knew about Kimo's Hula Pie and had looked forward to getting a piece.  However, by the time we had eaten as much of our dinner as we could stomach we were only looking forward to going somewhere else for dessert.",Mark S.,"Carlsbad, CA",4.0 star rating

We enjoyed sashimi appetizer, smoked fish, ribs, kalua pig and Mahi Mahi and Ono. We tried the fish prepared in coconut and the traditional styles, the coconut had more flavor to it and was a tiny bit spicy, so it was our favorite, their beet salad was very good too.  They have good, friendly service.  We did not think much of the Hula Pie, but that could be a personal preference.  It just tasted like a more dense, hydrogenated Cool Whip, covered in blah chocolate syrup nothing special.

The service was very good, I will give them that.  The location, can't be much more fun. But what do you go to do at restaurant?  Yes eat.
Would it hurt to invest a little in a sandwhich bun that wasn't from the bread aisle at Costco?  Come on guys, I would be willing to spend a couple of bucks more for something better.  I had the fish of the day sandwhich with Cajun spices, should have gone with the hamburger my wife had.  Oh well you get what you pay for and it was not a lot.  Hula pie, it is a signature.

While he was setting up, we walked up to him to tell him how much we enjoyed his concert in Napa and wanted to know if we could take a picture with him to text to our friends who have seen him in person many times.  His response was about as rude and disturbing as I could ever imagine.  Instead of just saying he was busy, he said, ""Do me a favor and get the f**k out of my way.""  The waitress who served us drinks (which were great) was wonderful - but Willy K is an awful excuse for a human being.  Two big thumbs down for him.

It's definitely one of the places where you get good value-for-money, especially in comparison with all of the other options (Wow, Maui is expensive with food!). It was pretty busy when we were there so unfortunately there was no more place outside, so instead we sat inside which limited the dining experience. Reason for no 4 stars: portions for the main dish are really small (mind you, I am from Europe so for an American they are WAY smaller than usual). I had the fish with lobster topping and it was barely enough to fill an empty stomach.

I had the shrimp tahitian and it was divine. Hubby had some kind of steak and slurped up every last bite. I was too busy having a Meg Ryan moment over my shrimp to remember what exactly he was eating. 

It gets crowded here fast, so get in early or be prepared to wait. Either that, or sit downstairs and order drinks and pupus and head elsewhere for your entree. When I'm back in Maui (in oh, 50 years), I plan on making Kimo's one of my first stops.

You can't do much better for dining scenery.  The service was great - you have one person dedicated to your table taking food orders and another person handling all drink orders.  You would think this could easily get screwed up, but it was very efficient.  

As far as the food goes, I thought it was excellent.  I can't remember what we had as an appetizer, but the salads were very good.  I went with a fish special of the day and ordered a piece of Monchong (first time I had this type of fist - like a flaky white fish) stuffed with lobster meat.  It was absolutely melt in your mouth.  It was one of the better meals I have had.  The Hula Pie for dessert was very good too, eventhough I am not a huge sweet fan.

There was a 30 minute wait for a table, but since we said we just wanted drinks we got a table in the bar area, and then the waitress told us we could order off the dinner menu too, so win win. They say the upstairs dining room is nicer, but it was raining so there was no view to speak of anyway. I had a margarita, and the waitress asked if I wanted Cuervo or Patron (Patron, thank you very much for asking), and DH had a mai tai, which he said was very good. When we decided to order dinner, we discovered it comes with Caesar salads, which were very nice and fresh. The fish dishes are listed in the menu with a variety of fish and a variety of preparations, but apparently they only have 1 fish per sauce, and the waitress listed what was available that night. I had the Ono in the Kimo's style which was basically a garlic butter sauce with basil and a side of quite tasty rice. DH had the pork ribs, which came as a huge full rack, but the meat, while tasty, wasn't exactly falling off the bone. Dinners come with a basket of bread and muffins which are really good. We saw everyone else ordering the hula pie for dessert, which is a huge slice of ice cream cake with hot fudge and whipped cream, but we were stuffed so we passed.

Also make a reservation ahead of time if you can cuz its always packed  The food is here is wonderful and generously portioned, especially for the price. You must try the hula pie!!! We missed out cuz we were too full and had to try it when we were on another island were they ship it over cuz it's so famous. So save a little room and try it at the place it originated.

8/25/2010,4.0 star rating,My husband and I went to Kimo's when we went to Maui for our honeymoon. This restaurant is located on Front street which has a lot of restaurants so you can get overwhelmed with all the choices. Request for the seats upstairs by the patio. Go there 45 minutes before sunset and you will be rewarded with a great view when they are serving your entree. It can get crowded since this area is very popular. Their menu is not that cluttered. You have choices of the fresh fishes of the day and choose how you'd want it prepared. The service is great and not too intrusive. We were able to get a coupon for free hula pie. That was a great treat! It could have been shared by 4 people.,Rachelle E.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating

i also ordered the hula pie that everyone was talking about..
i wanted to hate this pie because.. well i was expecting a pie..
i'll describe in a negative way first: it was a huge @ss mac nut ice cream on a thin oreo pie crust.. with chocolate syrup and cream on top..
soooo.. the pie is sooooooooooooo thin.. how can u call this a pie?!

positive way of describing it: IT WAS SO ADDICTING AND DEFINITELY DELICIOUS!!
i'm craving for it already!! i loved it.. and i wanted to eat it again!! grrr!!

Ended up not being able to finish the food we did order. I think the food itself was mediocre. My gf ended up getting a great salad, but I'd had better fish tacos on the island.

We sat at the upper level and were lucky to get a seat by the window. We started our meal with delicious carrot muffins that were served along with warm bread. They also have a good choice of cocktails.  I got the tropical itch- it was strong, delicious and hit the spot. My lobster stuffed mahi mahi was perfectly cooked and I loved the rice pilaf side even more. All seafood entrees come with a Caesar salad, so we didn't get any appetizers. I was so stuffed at the end of the meal but still decided to split the hula pie with my husband.  It was HUGE and delicious.

3/12/2010,3.0 star rating,"This place is located on Front Street Lahaina so parking may be tough.  If you look hard enough you'll find street parking unless you settle for a lot.  The view from the place was nice since it sits beach side.  Our group of twelve was seated on the patio.  As the group straggled in, they took our drink orders as each group arrived.  Once we all got there, they took our order.  The place filled up so we know it might be a wait until we get our food.  45 minutes later and when all the table have finished (even if they arrived after us), we finally got our orders.  Luckily some one in our group ordered the Hula Pie first to put something in our stomachs.  They assured us that our food is almost ready but, with the guaranteed gratuity for a large group I think we were put in the back of the line.  My wife and I split a burger with a sub of fries.  Not worth the $12 although the burger was prepared nicely.  We then split a Hula pie with some friends and that filled us up.  The food was average, price was higher, service was okay but slow and I left feeling unsatisfied.  That's why they are just okay.",Curtis L.,"Bothell, WA",4.0 star rating
5/28/2007,5.0 star rating,"And the seafood eating continues... I am a seafood whore so when I visit places like Maui or Key West, all I want to do is eat fish.  We walked by Kimo's about a half dozen times over the course of a week staying in Maui and had it on our to-eat list.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table upstairs and had a decent table.. The layout is a little funky upstairs because of the downstairs patio... I don't know how to explain it but even if you're sitting at the edge, you're not really at the water because over the overhang below.  

Whatever, minor details but I thought it was kind of annoying... I'm a picky bitch.  

My lobster stuffed mahi mahi was totes delicious.  Anytime you stuff anything with lobster or crab I'm most likely going to love it.  They also serve a caesar salad with main courses which was unique from all the other seafood dinners we had in Maui.  Not sure how much of a deciding factor that could be for someone but I thought it was nice.

Oh- one other weird thing, your server doesn't take your drink order... they have separate cocktail waitresses that walk around to take care of that.  Weird and maybe a little annoying too but whatever.  My food was good enough to make up for all the awkward quirks of this place.

Next time I'm in Maui I would definitely make this place a drinking hangout.  The downstairs is spread out and casual and open until 1:30 AM.",Derek B.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

As other yelpers have mentioned, they have wonderful seafood, views, service, and island ambiance.  Their fish is almost always cooked to perfection and tastes so fresh and delicious.  Their steaks are good, too, as well as the lobster tail.  

They have super yummy lava flows, and the hula pie is euphoric.  You definitely don't want to be indulging in these if you have to get in a bikini the next day, unless you've been doing some serious hiking, scuba diving, surfing, or some other calorie melting activity.  So make sure that you do, so you can indulge without the bulge.

2/22/2011,3.0 star rating,"We stumbled upon this place after looking for some other dessert options other than shave ice.  After repeated failed attempts at getting something at the Banyan Tree Bakery and Deli down the street (they closed at ~7pm on Saturday, and on Sunday they were closed when we were there at ~11am!) we decided to try this place over Famous Dave's.

We ordered the ""famed"" Hula Pie and the Lilikoi cheesecake.  Both were pretty good and decadent - just what we had in mind.  I leave a 3-star rating because of the way they handled seating us was off-putting.  

Like I stated, we came in just for dessert.  It was ~7:30pm and the place was pretty busy with people filing in making reservations.  Wait time to be seated was about 25-30 minutes.  The hostess directed me to the first come-first serve seating area adjacent to the bar.  We looked there but it was pretty busy with no tables available, so I returned to the hostess and asked if I can put my name down to be seated upstairs.  Apparently I misunderstood: dinner upstairs, dessert downstairs ONLY; as the hostess flat out told me ""We're not going to seat you upstairs just for dessert"".

We stayed and eventually got a table right at the water's edge.  The dessert was good, the smooth jazz was soothing, and the ambiance pretty nice.  But overall they made us feel like we were ""second class diners"" just because we were not going to spend money on a complete dinner.

Other than shave ice, Ka'anapili/Lahaina doesn't have a lot of dessert places.... =(

One last tip: If you are planning on going to Maui, be sure to bring a few re-usable shopping bags.  None of the stores hand out plastic anymore.",JN B.,"Eastvale, CA",4.0 star rating

Pricing was higher than what we would have paid here in San Diego and West Palm Beach Fl but we thought fair for Maui.
Our orders fish topped with lobster, parmesean crusted ono, seafood ciaoppino, filet mignon and 2 molokini Cut prime rib were very good.  The filet and prime rib were so tender and tasty.  We shared the chef's special HULA Pie with peanut butter and nuts, Cheese cake and Hula Pie.  All were great desserts.
Our waitress Sheri was right on top of things, remembering our drink orders, checking to see if we were okay and happy with our choices.
One recommendation was even the small  prime rib was big.  Could not finish it all.
We would recommend this restaurant!  In fact we even considered going back towards the end of our trip but decided to go to Lahaina grill instead.  That too was well worth every penny spent.

Where I have to give Kimo's credit is this is one place in Maui we've been to that actually catered to non-english speaking clientele. We've had to do a great amount of translation on this trip with our German in-laws and bill-paying time at meals is always a challenge. Some place charge a service fee no matter how many guests in your party, others do when there's more than a certain number of people in the party; while other don't charge anything. Kimo's had a laminated card that explained the gratuity policy in multiple languages so it was ""alles klar"" with our bill.

For dinner I always get the fresh fish prepared a different way. They have four different ways they prepare it and I have tried everyone and they are all wonderful.

She recommended the Opakapaka and made it sound so good we both ordered it. Our meal was arguably one of the best we had on our trip and the service was fantastic. Our waitress was very attentive and even came to apologize in advance about a potential delay as a 20-person party had ordered ahead of us but our food arrived no more than 5 minutes later.

I tell him let's send it back but he's frustrated already. He takes about 2 bites and he's done. On the other hand our prime rib and hula pie were excellent! They charge $3.99 extra for the potato, I think she should have taken it off the bill since she could see he didn't eat it and he had to wait for it but she didn't. Maybe she was new.

So I remember the last time I was at Kimo's  I had the prime rib and it was tasty.  I was not disappointed. It was a nice 14 oz med-rare cut with 2 huge mound of white rice (got to love that you can get white rice anywhere on the island!) I got the 32 oz last time and it was just too big.  Before we ordered they brought over a basket of warm rolls and pumpkin carrot muffins (oh, yeah!)  and we finished off the meal with their Hula Pie.   We came back here on our last day for lunch. Not as great as our last experience, I ordered the fish taco.....again, dried out.  What is up with seafood restaurants over cooking their fish???!  Everyone else order burgers, which I should have done...oh well, live and learn...we got another hula ple to make up for the fish taco!",Shirley M.,"Millbrae, CA",4.0 star rating

10/26/2009,4.0 star rating,"first, the freebies - their sourdough rolls are fresh and warm, the way all bread service should be! and their carrot muffins? it's so moist you almost want an order to go so you can make a midnight snack out of it.
the also give you a free ceasar salad. the dressing was good, with parmiggiano and a touch of black pepper.
and their herb rice pilaf. lordy - altho not the highlight of the meal, it was a close second. try it and you'll know what i'm talking about. 

now, on to the entrees:
we got the opah (hawaiian moon fish - white, moist fillet), oven roasted and lobster filled. the fish was perfectly cooked, moist and flakey. i was worried that the lobster would be too rich and heavy, but it was delicious! 

we also got the koloa pork ribs & polynesian chicken dish. while it wasn't terrible, i'd say stick to the fish - clearly the winners here. the pork wasn't fall of the bone and the chicken is a breast, so it was almost a tad bit dry. 

the opakapaka (snapper) was also really good - parmesan crusted. this was the waiter's recommended fish and it was delicious. it's lightly dusted with panko and parmesan. 

the fish dishes range from $30-39, but the quality was really noticeable. would def come back here, but for the fish only.",Lily L.,"Alamo, CA",4.0 star rating

5/29/2014,2.0 star rating,"Kimos uses beef grown in the mid-western US and shipped to the island, so if you want Hawaiian beef, try another place. We had eaten fish for dinner the past several nights and wanted beef, so we tried Kimos. The menu prices on their website are way out of date at this time, so be prepared for some sticker shock when you get the real menu. The service was very good; we arrived early for our 8:15 pm reservations and after we told the hostess we wanted medium rare prime rib she called the kitchen to confirm they still had it. She seated us early because they do tend to run out late in the evening. The meat was cooked perfectly and was tasty. However, with every other bite we both ended up with a wad of unchewable sinew in our mouth...not a pleasant experience.  Admittedly, beef is not the top seller on any of the menus here, but when I order it, I'd like it to be tender. BTW, Kimos does not validate parking in the city lot, so it cost us an extra $10 to park the car. The Lahaina Fish Co. where we ate last night does validate the tickets (and they offer prime rib).",JC A.,"Catawba, NC",4.0 star rating

Also had the pork ribs which were HUGE and couldn't even fit on the plate those are served with a rice pilaf which was tasty. The wine menu was well diversified and had a good price point. We also had a coupon from our hotel for a free Houla pie, which was soooooooooooo good!! Mac nut ice cream with an oreo crust and fudge and mac nuts on top.

Our hostess was very sweet, made sure we were comfortable (being that I have a hyper 3yr. old girl) while checking to see if our table was ready. As we were seated, it was cool to see that they had a cocktail server and a main server...must have been for that day because I have dined there quite a few times before and never experienced that. Unfortunately, we were notified that they had run out of their main draw to the place...Prime Rib!!! I've had it before but  two people in my party were drooling to try it. We were not to sad or upset because of the time we arrived and the menu CLEARLY states ""While it lasts"". Sooooooooo...for apps we had the calamari (eh...standard in the look and taste), the marlin bruschetta (pretty tasty ), and then the ahi poke tower, which was ono because the fish was fresh and not the frozen cubes you get at the poke counter in some supermarkets and the avocado BOULDERS were still that perfect green of a fresh opened one...kudos chefs! As for the entrees, the prime rib droolers opted for the filet mignon which was cooked perfect as to how they wanted it, and the side of the lobster...which was good, but the butter sauce was, do I dare say, kinda funky. I had the Lobster Topped fish of the day, OPAH!!! Opah is one of us local boyz favorite fishes to eat. The fish itself was perfect but the lobster topping was a little dry. Tell you what tho, the basmati and orzo rice bedding was freakin' awesome! This coming from a local bruddah that thinks shoyu and furikake on my white rice is da bomb! Much mahalo to our server, Will, for being  honest with us and making us feel like we were being catered to at his own home...now that is ""aloha"".

I give it 4 stars, but could drop to three, perhaps on a given day depending on the server and where you sit.  

So, be sure to make reservations for the evening, and ask for an outer table overlooking the ocean.  They fire up the Tiki torches and it is pure Hawaii (sort of ) after that.  

Food fare is mainly fish.  Sandwiches at lunch are really good. Dessert is Hula Pie that comes out as a humongous serving that could feed 4, not 1.

Once the sun went down they had what appeared to be a local band that was just starting to play when we were leaving. From the little we heard, they were great.  The prices are moderate about $25/plate (includes fresh rolls and muffins as well as a Caesar Salad to start). It was the ""nicest"" dinner we had while in Maui, but you could still get away with shorts and sandals, but you could also wear a cute dress and some casual heels. I ordered the chicken/steak combo and it was delish! I am more of a chicken person, so I have to say the chicken was amazing and I have been craving it since.

8/13/2010,4.0 star rating,"This is on the main drag overlooking the sea so guess what it is slammed every night. Happily compared to the formulaic approach of Bubba Gumps or Hard Rock Cafe it is a local joint with expensive but good food. Nothing too adventurous here just steak and fish and the fish is $30 plus a  main. Their idea of cutting edge is Seared Ahi but it is well executed and to make the $30+ tag more palatable you get a reasonable Caeser's and breads thrown in. So why do I like it? It has the best wine list on Maui. There may be some bigger but none that represent the value and range, whoever is buying the wine here knows their stuff; it has a nice mix of main stream and cult or small production all CA or WA. The most expensive wine on the list was Silver Oak cab '06 at $99, Mala down the road wanted that for average supermarket cabs that would cost $20 on the mainland. They had the '08 Prisoner for $69 which is a steal and doubly so for Maui.
Another cool thing is to sit on the bar which has great views and lots of tables and eat appetizers and drink the local beers, certainly the smart way to spend the 45-60 minute obligatory wait for a table.",Jim B.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

We shared the highly recommended Hula Pie and WOW, yummy!  Save room for this because you will not want to miss out on this dessert.  Lastly I had a mai tai and it was pretty good, much better than the one at Cheeseburger in Paradise.  Reservations are recommended.  We called earlier in the day and there was no wait for us.  Service was great!  The server, Ryan, was very nice, well spoken and knowledgable about everything on the menu.  May 2011",Michael E.,"Long Beach, CA",4.0 star rating
10/15/2008,5.0 star rating,"Fantastic fresh fish (Opah ""Kimo-Style"" is something I crave so badly I find myself pursuing airfares and booking a ticket over for!) in simple tasty preparations.  The location is dreamy, with the decks hanging out over the water - coming early for drinks and sitting near the deck railing gives you fantastic sunset views - with tiki torches burning and frequently live music in the evenings. 

Prices are typical Hawaii - although not as bad as you'd expect for being on the water and compare solidly to SF Bay Area prices. Decent - but not great wine list, tasty cocktails and awesome Hula Pie. This is a must go to place for me in Maui!",Jennifer C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4.0 star rating
6/19/2013,4.0 star rating,"We came here to watch the sunset on or last day in Maui - everyone else had the same idea so come early if this is what you want to do.  We got seated upstairs right away though - our view of the sunset was just a glimpse but that was fine since we had our 4 month old with us and it was a quieter part of the restaurant.  For appetizers we tried the poke and macadamia calamari - I would skip the calamari in the future, there's nothing special about it.  The poke was delicious with the guacamole and chips - wish the portion was a little bigger.  For drinks we both had the mai tai - the waitress said that is what they're known for - I wasn't a big fan, we both got a headache from it. For our meals my husband ordered the swordfish and I had the rare Ahi - both were tasty and fresh.  I was almost hit with a piece of hanging fan blade that broke off in the restaurant  and was extremely shaken up.  The manager and server checked on me immediately and were very accommodating - they offered on their own to comp the meal which was very generous.  Aside from that incident we enjoyed our food.",Molly J.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
2/11/2009,4.0 star rating,"Kimo's...hmm... this is an interesting place. 
I had read so many great reviews that I had to come and check it out- the food did indeed impress me, but $38 an entree?? (that is the Dutch in me coming out- I'm feeling rather cheap) 
We had a reservation; however, that didn't seem to matter because we waited for about 15 minutes past our reservation time- yes yes I understand when places are busy but we were REALLY hungry so I'm going to offer up my complaint. 
Now- the hostess stand is run by about six little teenie-boppers with tight tank tops and short skirts- hmm...I question the professionalism there, but your in Maui where I suppose exceptions are made. 
Aside from the distracting hostess stand the ambiance of the place is pretty neat- they do have a really neat patio. 
We sat on the patio with a pretty nice view of the water. 
Our server, Ronnie, was great! They had six specials the night we were there and I watched him sound them off to each and every table that night.. what a mouthful! 
Overall the food was great, my table tried the Parmesan crusted Ono and the ginger spiced Mahi Mahi.

1/24/2010,4.0 star rating,I absolutely adore there carrot muffins and fresh sour dough bread that you get with your traditional salad with every entree. The carrott muffins have the perfect amount of spice and sweetness and the sour dough bread is just tangy enough and brings me back home to San Francisco! We always ask for an extra bag to bring them home with us for breakfast in our hotel room. It's hard to not fill up on this suckers before your meal arrives. The Kimo's salad (the same as Lahlanis in Whaler's Village) has the most amazing caesar or caesar influenced dressing. It's a basic salad with mainly lettuce and a crouton or 2 but the dressing and fresh cracked pepper def make it. I blog about food and love this place.,sydney k.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

10/16/2009,2.0 star rating,"The fish dishes were good, but not good enough if you can't sit outside next to the water. The interior is dark and hot! 

None of the people in our group really appreciated boardwalk part of Front Street in Lahaina at all....cute buildings...but just crowded and touristy. Touristy in that there are hawkers at the door of some places trying to lure you inside to eat...yikes! I find that atmosphere hard to enjoy.  (Though we did love the banyan tree). 

So, Kimo's is maybe worth three stars if it wasn't smack dab in such a cheesy area. Everywhere you turn someone is giving you a coupon for a free hula pie with purchase of two entrees at Kimo's. I dunno, just would have preferred less of a chain restaraunt feel.

9/20/2009,4.0 star rating,"So, if you're in Maui and anywhere near Lahaina, it's worth checking out Kimo's.  It's not the kind of fancy food you would find at the French Laundry in Napa, but it's great food with a killer view in the heart of Lahaina.  You wait for your table at a bar with the best view in the place, so the ""wait"" doesn't feel that bad.   A mai thai or two later and your table is usually ready (or you can make reservations-- always a good idea!)  Dinners at Kimo's are a selection of fresh Hawaiian fish prepared a number of different ways.  Salad and fresh carrot muffins and sourdough rolls are included with your entree.  Whatever you do, save room for dessert.  Their signature dessert is ""Hula pie"" which is macadamia nut ice cream in a oreo cookie shell covered in fudge.

I go with Yelpers, and you didn't steer me wrong. My prime rib was yummy, although not the best that I've ever had, I can't judge against other prime rib offerings on the island. The Hula Pie thing, though, is pretty spectacular. You have to like ice cream a lot, which I do, so it was perfect. Plus, if you save your receipt, you can come back anytime again - no matter how many years pass - and get a free one! Good Mai Tais, could use a bit of work on their wine menu for by the glass, though.

12/3/2008,4.0 star rating,"I've been to Kimo's twice, over a span of 5 years. Their service has remained consistent over time. The service is always extremely friendly. The first time I went was for a regular dinner. The second and most recent time was for Thanksgiving. 

The first time I went, I don't remember what I ordered, but I remember it was good and I couldn't finish it. They are very generous with their portions. For Thanksgiving, I ordered Cioppino and finished it, but my fiancee and his parents ordered the Thanksgiving dinner and couldn't finish it. I tasted the turkey, stuffing (which I normally don't even like), cranberry sauce, and potatoes and I thought they were all equally good. We all received a good amount of food in our order. They received pumpkin pie with their turkey dinners, which I don't have a taste for, but they did say it was really well made. I had to order the Hula Pie. 

The Hula Pie deserves it's own review! But, I will keep it short. I ordered the Pie the first time around, it's one of Kimo's bests. Between 7 people, we shared a Hula Pie and maybe a cheesecake. This time around for Thanksgiving, all four of us picked at it and couldn't even put down 1/4 of it. I had it wrapped up, we took it home, and all four of us ate it for dessert the following night. It was just as delicious even though half of it melted. The Hula Pie is an ice cream cake. It's not like a Baskin Robbins cake, it has no cake in it, it's all ice cream with an Oreo cookie-type bottom. The ice cream is macadamia nut, with plenty of nuts to go around so that every bite of it has an abundance of macadamias. They drizzle hot chocolate syrup over the top as well and top it off with some whipped cream. It sounds simple, and it really is, but the taste is out of this world. I don't do desserts or sweets that often but I love me some Hula Pie and Kimo's has the best. You can easily get a free Hula Pie coupon but even if you don't, just order it.

The last visit my partner had the Prime rib that was very moist and tender. I enjoyed the Orange - ginger macadamia nut crusted opakapaka. I think the free Caesar salad is a welcome change for Maui.  The  Koloa pork ribs are okay but the sauce is typical store brand. The Hula Pie is a must, when it arrives turn it on it's side and let is warm up a few minutes then it's easy to eat.

The drinks were great. The food was astounding! Like in the movies when you see people eat something and its like they are having a food-gasm. That good. We had lobster and swordfish that was so fresh and well prepared and just effing delicious.  When the meal was over and we were about to leave, our waiter stopped us and told us how cool and great it was to see two people that were so obviously in love and so happy and enjoying each other.

3/3/2009,5.0 star rating,"This place is amazing! It's a favorite of my extended family who live on Maui, so we hit it up on our long drive back from Hana. It was dark so we didn't get to see the lovely view, but we sat at a table on the 2nd floor with the wall open between you and the ocean. I could hear the waves gently crashing on the shore, and saw a little rowboat rocking back and forth. Good enough for me!
I was set on fish - and they had lots of choices. Four were on special and could be prepared a number of ways. With your meal you get a bread basket (sourdough rolls and carrot muffins) and a salad. THEN the main course comes along and it was soooo yummy. All of us perked up quite a bit - the Road to Hana took a beating on us!

We stayed at a hotel where they gave away ""Free Hula Pie"" cards with any 2 entrees ordered - so we ordered 2 Hula Pies. Now listen, if you have 4 people in your party, 1 Hula Pie will be more than enough. This things is a monstrous slice of ice cream pie with an oreo-cookie crust, fudge top and drizzled chocolate all over. It was amazing and I took home the tons of left overs to eat over the next 4 days :)

Salt and lemon helped a little and the bun was pretty good (the bread can make or break a sandwich, IMO). My husband's plate lunch looked only so-so as well.

they have a nice patio downstairs for cocktails & pupus overlooking the beach, which is nice.  we had dinner upstairs and it smelled a little dingy.  again, we were sooo hungry, it just didn't matter anymore at that point.  all entrees are served w/ their signature caesar salad.  neither of us remember how great the meal was but it must not have been all that bad bc we managed to inhale it in about 10 minutes flat.

The seafood chowder was tasteless, salad dead with bottled flavor cesar dressing.  My wife had the prime rib, which was all fat (they did take it off the bill), I had fresh local fish which was just ok, but nothing special.  This place is like the Black Angus or Red Lobster of Maui, like a chain restaurant.  Our server mumbled through the specials and was less than attentive to our table.  He was a bit overwhelmed, probably not cut out for the job.  I won't hold that against the restaurant, because that happens sometimes.  He wasn't doing it on purpose, just a little lost.

Well we certainly don't expect restaurants to have fresh fish all the time, but not rotten stinky fish. After we were seated, the server gave us good suggestions for the starters and we ordered macadamia nut calamari- turned out to be boring. Then he suggested baked kimo style mahi mahi(fresh) - melted in our mouth(lil too much pesto sauce though). He also suggested the lobster topped fish dish, mahi mahi again- reallyy yummm. We really enjoyed both entrees. Next came desserts and my husband decided to try to chefs special hula pie- biggest mistake ever.

4/25/2010,4.0 star rating,"The setting was very nice here and the service was much better than most restaurants in Maui. The bread is very good. We split a combo plate special and that was enough for 2 people, but if you were to each order your own entree, it could get pricey. I had read that their kula pie is delicious, but I didn't find it all that impressive. But our entree of steak, shrimp, and mahi mahi was excellent. We spent $50 so it is quite pricey.",Jennifer P.,"La Habra, CA",4.0 star rating
8/11/2008,4.0 star rating,Kimo's is a nice place. Great fresh fish. Nice spot to have a drink. The out door seating is great. See the sun set and have a great dinner. Service was good and friendly. Fun place to enjoy Maui. This place is one that I plan on going back to over and over. Loved Kimo's do not change a thing.,tim S.,"Sacramento, CA",4.0 star rating

9/27/2007,3.0 star rating,"I went here for drinks out on their deck. Service was great along with the live music & being able to see the water. However, the seats were uncomfy since they were made of wood & had no cushion for the bottom. The atmosphere was relaxed yet had a touch of class. Not a place I would take kids though from observing the fact that it was mainly adults at this restaurant.",Bony K.,"Encinitas, CA",4.0 star rating
8/19/2005,4.0 star rating,"Let's get this straight! This is a three star place with a five star location in a restaurant market where some four stars places charge more than Thomas Keller could hope to ask for. (A ""surf and turf"" special only $87 at one offender!) Kimo's was recommended to us by a local business owner (a guy down the street at the Glass Mango) as a good place for lunch. And I only wish we would have come back for dinner. Several of the other places we went were overpriced and the food was below par. Kimo's is straight forward, simple food served by largely competent folks in a stunning setting overlooking the ocean toward Lanai. The lunch was reasonable and the fish was very good both times.",Alex C.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
8/21/2007,4.0 star rating,Beautiful view with the ocean literally hitting the sidewalls of the deck you sit on. We had lunch here and I had a really good mahi mahi with tropical salsa and my mom had an ahi salad that she wanted to go back for later in the week.,Erin O.,"Neighbors Southwest, Beaverton, OR",4.0 star rating
3/29/2007,5.0 star rating,"Only had dessert - we had some crazy ice-cream dessert with Oreo crust, ""sailors would swim to shore for this one"" was the tagline on the menu :-)  Location was great - sitting on the balcony over the water, we actually got sprayed by the ocean!",Peter and Julie H.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating
11/26/2007,4.0 star rating,"Ate here for lunch and it gets 4 stars because of it's view and location.  The food would get a 3.5..  Had the fish taco and it was pretty good.  I still regret not ordering the Hula Pie, as I saw another customer having it on the way out and it looked goooood. 

If you are shopping around downtown Lahaina this is a great place to stop and have lunch.    It's rght on the ocean.",Britney C.,"Dallas, TX",4.0 star rating
1/8/2006,2.0 star rating,"If you like bad service but Old Hawaiian style this is the place for you. Their menu is basically choose an entree and get an accompanying Caesar salad. Most of the options are local fish prepared one of several ways, prime rib, steak, or shrimp. I found the entrees to be pretty mediocre they couple of times I went here. Even the fish, which I expect to be well be prepared at a fish specialty place were mediocre. Don't get sucked in here, there are way better places within walking distance and I would recommend those over Kimo's anytime. One thing it does have going for it is that the portions are absolutely huge and they serve good muffins instead of bread.",Keith R.,"San Carlos, CA",4.0 star rating
6/17/2007,4.0 star rating,"Prime rib and pork ribs were our choices for dinner. Both extremeley delish. The pork ribs fell right off the bone. The prime rib isn't as yummy as House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, but maybe it's bc I've gone to HoPR way too many times. My bf got the 32oz which was SO HUGE. I didn't think he could finish it, but he managed. Oh, and fresh baked breads and ceasar salad come with every meal.  I love their wonderful ocean views, and try to get there around sunset if you can! The service was also very good. Our waiter and barmaid took great care of us!",J K L.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

9/2/2006,5.0 star rating,"Five stars for the Hula Pie alone.  I expected a small sliver of pie/cake.  What we received was a monstrosity of a piece - but we had no problem devouring the whole thing.  The Caesar salad was good, but the dressing was pretty strong so I would recommend getting it on the side.  My boyfriend had the prime rib, which was wonderful.  Very juicy, cooked to perfection, and tender.  I ordered the lobster stuffed halibut - the name of the dish says it all.  There was a ton of lobster in the ""stuffing"" with a hearty helping of halibut.  Kimo's can be pricey, but not compared to some of the other places in Lahaina.  It's a good option if you want fish AND beef.  If you just want beef, I'd recommend Ruth's Chris.",Ann B.,"Vancouver, WA",4.0 star rating
10/19/2006,4.0 star rating,"We never miss Kimo's when we're in town.  Great fresh fish - you select the cooking method - and excellent desert, so don't miss the Hula Pie, which is enormous and can feed 2-4 people depending on how much sugar your body can stand before you pass out.  Also, these serve these excellent muffins instead of bread - pumpkin maybe?  I can never tell.  The service can be hit or miss, and you need to sit upstairs overlooking the ocean for the full effect.",Angela B.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating
1/15/2009,1.0 star rating,"Hands down, the worst dining experience I have ever had. I've been there before and the food was always just okay but we decided to go there for our New Year's Eve dinner because of the good location on Front Street and because the bar area was supposed to be fun. 

Problem #1: Our reservation was for 8:30. They got around to seating us at 9:30. No explanation. 
Problem #2: They sat our party of 9 at a table for 6. When we asked for a bigger table, they said ""we always sit parties of 9 at this table and no one has ever complained."" Like we were insane for not wanting to sit on each others laps for dinner. We gave in after we were told another wait of undetermined time would ensue if we wanted another table. 
Problem #3: The carpet SMELLS. Like wet dog. 
Problem #4: Out of the 6 different types of fish on the menu, they were sold out of all but ONE. 
Problem #5: They ran out of vegetables. So we got white rice instead. With our one fish, of course. Are you kidding me??? 
Problem #6: Seeing how they were basically out of all food by the time they got around to taking our order, we specifically asked that we had a Hula Pie put aside for us for dessert. Well, guess what, our server didn't put it aside and lo and behold they ran out by the end of dinner. 
Problem #7: We ask to talk to the manager. (We NEVER do this by the way; it embarrasses us to death.) We have never been treated as badly as we were treated by Ryan Monahan, the manager. He unapologeticlly told us that he was happy because they served a lot of other tables that evening. His attitude was pretty much ""sucks for you"". He said that there was nothing he could do for us. Really??? 

I know NYE is busy. So if at any point in the evening we had a sincere apology for a terrible evening, you wouldn't be reading this review.",Erin G.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
12/11/2008,3.0 star rating,"if it weren't for the view, this place would've gotten like...2 stars.  i didn't really like paying way too much for a fish sandwich on soft soggy bread.  it's a nice place bc of their patio seating, but the food wasn't anything to comment on.  i could get that kind of food at TGIFridays....and i hate chain restaurants.",Sally T.,"Berkeley, CA",4.0 star rating

7/17/2011,5.0 star rating,"came here for dinner one night and had a wonderful experience! right when you get seated you get 2 bread rolls and 2 carrot muffins. yum! took awhile for our waiter to come but it was busy which was understandable and he did pop by to apologize and let us know he was coming. he explained the fish very well and gave reccomendations. i ordered the lobster stuffed opa and boyfriend got the 14oz prime rib with an extra lobster tail. all dishes come with caesar salad which was lite and tasty. the fish was soo tasty with the sweet lobster! i loved it. and since the food took a little while longer to come out, our waiter came by, apologized and told us dessert was going to be on the house. wow! really? i feel like we were only waiting maybe 5 minutes longer than usual. hula pie is awesome! soo good chocolately! and the live music and no ceilings so you hear the waves hitting while eating dinner was just a wonderful feeling. kimos will definitely be somewhere i will go to everytime im in maui! just stay away from leilani's on the beach which is owned by the same owner i believe!!",Amanda C.,"Cupertino, CA",4.0 star rating
10/4/2009,3.0 star rating,Came here for lunch while visiting Old Town Lahaina.  We put too much money in the parking lot meter and needed a spot to kill time.  This restaurant is part of the Duke's franchise and has pretty much the same menu.  It's a total tourist spot so of course everything is overpriced but you forget all that when seated outside.  The view is beautiful!  Order a couple of drinks and an appetizer or 2 and you won't be disappointed.  I usually order their crab wantons and quesadillas which are are pretty good.   Just sit back and enjoy the view.,Lori A.,"Daly City, CA",4.0 star rating
9/29/2008,3.0 star rating,"After a long drive to Hana and back, Kimo's was recommended to us by the owner of a local dive shop.  When we got to the place, it was about a 30 minute wait so we found a seat at the bar.  It was a nice setting with outdoor seating and on the waterfront.  I had the Prime Rib and she had the Seafood Cioppino.  The prime rib was just what I needed to end the day... 32oz of pure deliciousness.  It was big enough for the both of us.  The Seafood Cioppino was ok.  The only problem with the experience was one of the bartenders was a bit unfriendly.  Not sure if it was because we were non-locals but we didn't do anything to provoke it.  The other bartender was much more talkative and took care of us.  I would definitely go back for the prime rib if i'm ever in Lahaina.",Anthony T.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating
10/28/2008,4.0 star rating,"Okay so I used to work here, I'm completely biased. Then again,  I have eaten everything on the menu and experienced the ambience nightly so I've got the insider scoop ya'll. This isn't a place for vegetarians, take your wirey self elsewhere cuz this joint is for steak and fresh fish mmmk. They have quality food if not the most gourmet or variety of selection.  The atmosphere is just about the best you're gona get on the island. People are always all concerned about sitting right on the railing for an ocean view, and let me tell you even in the back of the restaurant you've got a better view of the ocean than any other restaurant on the strip. So sit where you're f_n put and don't complain, or be sure to request the railing with your reservation and expect to wait a little longer to sit. The mai tai is the best on the island by the way, hands down I like how another yelper referred to it as ""panty dropping"" yes that is the best description dammit. They have a great big giant quivering prime rib, the best fish prep is parm crusted, and everyone loves hula pie that cookie crust is fabulous don't neglect it. The service is just about unbeatable, fast and super friendly- it's ""good people"". Kimo's is the best dining experience you'll likely have in Lahaina.",Audrey S.,"Lahaina, HI",4.0 star rating
9/17/2009,5.0 star rating,"For our first family trip to the neighbor island of Maui, this place is what made our vacation in May 2009. We like the ocean front, live band, great friendly waiters. But most of all we LOVED the 32 OZ PRIME RIB! (((TEXAS STYLE))) The ""parents"" went back a couple weeks after, because they were craving it so bad HAH! I recommend this place to someone who loves some good Prime Rib:)",Leilani D.,"Waianae, HI",4.0 star rating
2/18/2009,4.0 star rating,"Kimo's has one of the best spots to watch the sunset.  The lounge area creates a great atmosphere for knocking back a few.  The drinks are pretty good and the ambiance is fantastic.  The only gripe I have about this place is how can you serve a full menu only at the bar and not at the lounge area where there are actual tables???  This makes no sense to me at all.  If you can't get a seat at the bar, then you can sit in the lounge area.  They have a very limited pupu (appetizer) menu, so don't come hungry or else you'd be drinking on empty.  That's not a bad thing either.  I believe there's only 4 items on there.  I wouldn't go back there for the pupu, but the drinks and the hula pie with the added ambiance, I'd go back in a heart beat.  Check this place out if you get a chance.  But if you want to engage in a full dinner, you'd better make reservations way in advance.",Matt P.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
