7/28/2017,5.0 star rating,"What a treat! We had a 6pm dinner reservation and started with drinks and appetizers. Our server, Aaron, has to be one of the best on Maui. We were treated so well, thank you, Aaron. 
Dinner was served about 4 minutes before sunset. Couldn't have timed it any better. The ambience, service, food, the entire experience was ALOHA. The manager, Austin, spent a few minutes with us. Great guy. 
We finished the evening with cheesecake and strawberry shortcake. 
We have a new favorite spot to celebrate n",J W.,"Lahaina, HI",3.0 star rating
4/7/2017,4.0 star rating,"We decided to eat at Relish Oceanside on our last morning for breakfast before checking out of the Westin and heading home. 

PROTIP: You have to be very specific of where you want to sit. There's kind of 2 sides to this place. There's the ""pool side"" area which was breakfast buffet serve yourself or you can ask to be seated on the oceanside and that side is full menu with waiter service. We asked to sit on the ocenside and the service was impeccable. It also might be important to mention that you cannot make reservations, so you'll need to go and wait once you put your name in. The wait wasn't too bad though, only about 10 minutes. 

For breakfast I had the coffee (which was delicious and strong) and an omelette which was great as well!!

My husband had the French toast and a side of Maui Gold pineapple spears. The French toast was ok, but the coconut syrup that it came with was delicious!! Of course the pineapple spears were amazing because....well they're Maui Gold pineapple spears. 

The location was beautiful. We had an amazing ocean view on the lovely patio. 

We really enjoyed this place as our last meal before leaving the beautiful Maui!!",Katie W.,"Corona, CA",3.0 star rating
9/2/2017,2.0 star rating,The only good thing about this restaurant is the view and the service.  We ordered most of the appetizers and an entree. The food wasn't very good.  I swear 1 of the drinks we ordered from the bar didn't even have alcohol in it.  The prices are outrageous for what you get and the quality of food is not on par with how much you are paying for it.  Like I said the only good thing is the view and the nice people that work their.,Richard M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3.0 star rating

11/7/2016,2.0 star rating,"My husband and I had dinner here one night during our honeymoon in early October. We had a $150 dining credit from our Costco vacation package, so we wanted to use it. 

Reservations: We made a reservation for 6:15, right after sunset, from the Westin Maui website. We didn't need the reservation at all because it was pretty empty at that time. About half an hour to an hour after sunset, more people arrived, so a reservation might be a good idea if you're planning on eating here after 7:00 pm.

Ambiance: It is quite romantic and beautiful as it's right by the ocean, but since it was windy that night (well, the entire week), we were seated closer to the building than the ocean. We could still see the ocean, but it would've been more scenic if we were able to sit closer to the ocean. After the sun sets, there isn't much lighting, so your eyes have to adjust to the low lighting. I think a few more fire lights after the sun sets would have created a better lighting and sight experience. 

Food: We read from reviews that the food is alright, so we knew that going in. We ordered the pork belly buns, blue crab and macadamia nut mahi mahi, furikake seared ahi, a side of mashed potatoes, and a chocolate cake ice cream dessert. I liked the pork belly buns and the mashed potatoes the most, which is saying something. The mahi mahi and the ahi were just okay. We also ordered cocktails, which were too sweet for both of us. 

Service: Our server was extremely nice and accommodating. If we hadn't been using our $150 dining credit, then I would've asked the prices for the specials and for the side dishes, as they aren't listed on the menu. 

Overall: I'd recommend using your Maui Westin dining credits here. If you don't have any dining credits for any Maui Westin restaurants, then I'd suggest going elsewhere for food. Maui has so much good food to offer outside of its hotels and resorts!",Di W.,"Seattle, WA",3.0 star rating
12/29/2016,4.0 star rating,"My fianc√©e and I serendipitously decided to eat here on 12/20/2016.  We were happily surprised.  We split a Pupu Slate, House Salad, Taro Focaccia, Crab Mahi, and a Furikaka Ahi, plus a cocktail and wine.  Everything was served with a visually appealing presentation.  The pupus were varied and delicious.  The papaya seed dressing gave the salad a light and unusual flavor.  We both unexpectedly loved the taro focaccia.  The fish entrees were perfectly cooked.  The serving staff was attentive and helpful when we asked to move our table out of the wind.  Some people below griped about the price, but considering what we ordered and what something comparable would cost back home in Seattle, we thought it was a fair value.

My only gripe was the low level of overall illumination.  I see a few others complained about this below as well.  We had to use the flashlight apps in our phones a few times, which was annoying.  A little more warm light illumination would have made a more romantic atmosphere, too.  It was just a bit too dark for us where we happened to be sitting.  YMMV.",C D.,"Bothell, WA",3.0 star rating
8/16/2016,3.0 star rating,"Well deserved 3 stars for the view and atmosphere. The waiter & everyone was very welcoming I'll give that to them as well. However, the main point is the food and it wasn't appetizing. I had the pork belly steam buns and it looked like a dinner roll cut in half  with pork in the middle. The service took a while so I don't recommend this place for families with kids or who are in a rush to go somewhere. It's a great setting but the food options need a little work.",Maylene B.,"Wailuku, HI",3.0 star rating
8/8/2017,2.0 star rating,"Service was good, everything else was bad. The wine was terrible, the drinks terrible, the food was way over priced and extremely salty! Charged $5 for a side of rice! Would not recommend! Make a reservation or wait at any other restaurant in Kaanapali!",Jordan M.,"San Ramon, CA",3.0 star rating
2/6/2017,5.0 star rating,"We ate here on the first night of our honeymoon. The outdoor space was beautiful (quite literally next to the ocean) but it was unusually chilly and windy and I was not dressed for it. As soon as we were seated at our table, a member of the staff offered me a towel to drape over my shoulders so I could enjoy my meal without freezing. I was impressed all night with the level of attentiveness we saw from the staff. 

We ordered our drinks (I had an Elderflower Punch and it was delicious) and received our appetizer, the Toybox Tomato and Burrata salad. I'm usually sold right away on any dish featuring tomatoes, but my favorite part of this dish was the burrata. It was creamy and rich, without being overpowering. I could have eaten two more orders of it!

Our entrees took quite a bit longer to come out, but our server made sure to let us know what was going on each step of the way. By the time our food got to us, we realized pretty quickly it was worth the wait. I ordered the Meyers Lemon Chicken and my husband got the Seafood Hot Pot. Both of our dishes were PERFECT. My favorite part of my meal was definitely the Brussels sprouts with the bacon lardon (anything with bacon gets a thumbs up from me), but the chicken was cooked to perfection. My husband's meal was seasoned beautifully and was probably the best thing he could've ordered, considering we were both a little cold. 

After we'd finished our entrees, our server brought out a dessert menu and let us know our dessert would be on the house, due to the longer wait time for entrees. We weren't feeling dessert, but I ordered a (very generously poured) Irish coffee. As we finished our coffee, our server returned and informed us that the manager had actually taken our entrees off our bill entirely due to the wait time. We opened the bill and felt as though we were stealing from them! The food was incredible, and matched only by their level of hospitality. We'll certainly be back; they made the first night of our honeymoon!",Lillian P.,"Mililani, HI",3.0 star rating
2/17/2017,4.0 star rating,"Happy hour from 5-7pm. Our waitress was great and helped us get our drink orders in before hh ended. No food for hh, just drinks. $10 a drink which is a good deal for this tourist trap area",Tony I.,"Cleveland, OH",3.0 star rating
1/12/2016,5.0 star rating,"Oh, Relish....thank you for a perfect evening! We visited for an early dinner around 5:30, since the sun set is pretty early. We were greeted kindly and seated on the lawn right by the sand- a perfect ocean view. 

Call me crazy, but drinking out of a pineapple was a major priority for me. Seriously, how much more tropical can you get? Our server, Aaron, shared in our delight as we squealed over the option to put any cocktail in a pineapple. While our drinks were half price, the pineapple ""cup"" was $8. Steep, but I am not kidding when I say I required this damn pineapple. Hah!

Our entrees were ""buy one, get one half off."" This is high-quality, fresh, and nicely presented food. What a deal! We had the blue crab and macadamia nut mahi mahi, served with rice, asparagus, and a heavenly cream sauce garnish, as well as the Hawaiian-style BBQ ribs, served with macaroni and potato salad (needed some seasoning) and a delicious broccoli slaw.

We dined and left with the biggest smiles. Our bus boy even packed up our empty pineapple vessels so we could make our own cocktails to fill them with later! (I'm a dork, I know.  A happy dork.)

5/7/2016,4.0 star rating,"Service - excellent, waters poured before everyone was seated, knowledgeable server 

Food-
+lobster chowder, appetizer, small portion but very rich. Delicious. 
- Flatbread, caprese style with roasted tomato and burratta cheese.  Don't bother with it. Lacking in flavor all around, akin to prego marinara on tough flatbread with fresh sliced tomatoes ( not roasted as described) 
+island curry, mouthwatering lemongrass and coconut curry broth. The curries are clearly the star at this establishment. The depth of flavor brought us back to Thailand. 
+ seared ahi entree, just barely seared with a beautiful ruby red on the inside. 

Beverage - most of us had wine and found the suggested pairings to be excellent 


Ambience - good if you're seated away from the bar.  It was raining on and off the night we went, so they stopped seating in their ocean front section. We were in the back,  just under a large plasma screen and the wine fridge. The glow from both of these was off putting, as was the server traffic behind us. The chairs were mismatched and the table,  wobbly. It provided an unfortunate contrast to the elegant food.",A N.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",3.0 star rating
8/28/2016,3.0 star rating,Service was decent. Food was so-so. $36 for two small pieces of fish is nuts...better options at Roy's or elsewhere. Garlic shrimp was too salty to eat.

When the $28 salmon came it was laughable. I get it, it is Maui price but at least give us some decent food. 1 and 1/2 fingerling potatoes and 3 mushrooms, over salty over cooked salmon.",Tyler S.,"Austin, TX",3.0 star rating
4/20/2017,2.0 star rating,"Food was just ok. The wait for a table was also not bad, maybe 7 minutes. There was such a long wait for food, it took 30 min just to get out appetizers... the waitress was ok, not overtly kind or friendly. Honestly just an ok experience, which would be fine if it was a fast food place... but it's a nice expensive restaurant. Idk, maybe we came on a bad night?",Rachel A.,"Rochester, NY",3.0 star rating
10/2/2016,3.0 star rating,"We stayed at the Westin Resort and Spa. First night here we tried the house restaurant, Relish Oceanside. The location was fantastic, wanst overly crowded which made us a little leary. Had a great table with ocean sunset view. Waiter was friendly, attentive and helpful.  The menu selection was beet limited. We had meat and cheese plate appetizer which was good, not great but good. Wife wasn't very hungry so she ordered a beet salad with host cheese and I got the pawns over parrafalle. My plate was very good and a lot of food but wife's salad was not too her liking, way too much cheese. 

A guitarist was playing wonderful music and the setting was beautiful. So the drawbacks were very limited menu and one dish was below par. Is give it another chance though.",T F.,"Hollister, CA",3.0 star rating
4/10/2017,3.0 star rating,"Had dinner here tonight starting at 6 so watching the sunset with drink in hand was great. Can't beat the scenery. A few of us had specialty drinks which were excellent, and at $10 for the happy hour price, not too bad a value considering the location. I would have ordered another before hh ended but our server hardly ever came to check on us! By the time she came back we were half way through dinner and I didn't feel like another drink. 
I had ahi, my wife had salmon. Ahi was so-so with a small salad accompaniment. My wife's salmon was tasty but the sides were pretty ho-hum. For the price (expensive) I expect more refined flavours in all aspects of the dish. The desserts I tried (cheesecake, banana parfait) were good but not remarkable.

7/19/2016,4.0 star rating,"The atmosphere here is wonderful with live music playing that's not over powering to where you can't hear each other talk. The fans circulate the air very well so it's not hot at all. 

I came here today because I wanted a nice drink with an appetizer. My first dish didn't turn out so well and I was over it. They took it back and asked if it's like something else. Normally I'm done, but since I was starving and they were so nice about it. I got another appetizer. Second time around was awesome. Stefano,  the manager worked on making things right.

12/22/2016,3.0 star rating,"We had such a good time on the beach that when it is dinner time, the two hot restaurants nearby have the wait time of 45 min to one hour. Relish Oceanside, on the other hand, had a lot of empty tables. So you know this is not the super hot restaurant on the block.

The good part, the view is just unbeatable. It is right off the beach, the wind, the fire torch, the lights, it is very beautiful. The food is fresh. We ordered lobster chowder, bread, salmon, sticky ribs, and seafood hot pot. The ingredients are all very fresh. The taste is good. The seafood is a little bit too salty.

The not so good part, it is very pricy. The seafood hot pot had 4-5 pawns, one piece of fish, a lot of mushrooms ( as an Asian, I know it is the cheap mushroom, $1.5-$2 for a box), and two baby bok choy. It is a little too pricy to charge $40 for that.

The waiters are all very nice, while somehow they are quite slow, even there are not many guests. 

With its connection to Westin and its price tag, I expect better food quality.",Qian T.,"San Jose, CA",3.0 star rating
7/11/2015,1.0 star rating,"An Oceanside Maui restaurant has to be really bad to earn just 1 star, but here we are.

Pros: 

It's Oceanside. We got seats closest to the sand overlooking the sunset/evening. Calm waters were soothing.

Cons: 

Food: I got the ribs. My wife got the salmon. The food was a concoction of bland and terrible. The meals felt as if they'd been microwaved. Sad reality.

Price for this quality. We both ended up eating only 1/4 of the food on our plate all while paying close to $90 for two dishes, two drinks.

Service: Our waitress was new and very nice. Seems like she will have a bright future, but the overall service was slower than expected.

Overall: With the competition next door, we expected much more here. It was a disappointing outing to be sure.",Esco J.,"Panorama City, CA",3.0 star rating
10/10/2015,4.0 star rating,"I couldn't see another restaurant with a better view in all the beachside restaurants that lined Kanapaali beach.  We got there a little after 5, and literally got the best seat in the house, front row view to the gorgeous sunset!  We saw one couple get engaged right before our eyes, and we all clapped, lol.  On top of the view, we got to enjoy the happy hour deals which were bogo half off entrees, 20% off salads and apps, $4wine or beer, and $7 cocktail specials.

The food was pretty good, I got the Mahi with crab which was great.  It came on top of rice and asparagus with a slightly sweet sauce (caramel).  We think this might be their play on Mama's fish house's version. My wife got the pesto pasta dish which was also good.  Ironically, the table behind us also got the exact same thing.  We also had the caprese salad for appetizer, which was just alright. I guess that's what you get for tomatoes when it's not in season (they were slightly overripe). It also had a slightly different flavor than a typical caprese (with buratta instead of mozzerella) maybe a slight garlic flavor? The maui onions accented it well with a sweet spicyness. 

Our waiter was very patient with us as we took a billion photos of the food and sunset, and was pretty nice to us.  We'll definitely come back for the views! He also encouraged the tables behind us to order so they could take advantage of the happy hour deals as well.",Mas M.,"Redwood City, CA",3.0 star rating
4/11/2017,2.0 star rating,"Disappointing.  It was Sunday night, so maybe the chief chef wasn't working.  Our crab encrusted Mahimahi lacked flavor, and the prawns pappardelle noodles stuck together.  The prawns were also overcooked, so dinner wasn't what we'd hoped.  The service was slow, so much so that the table behind us asked for the check as soon as their entrees finally arrived. The bar, on the other hand, was a nice experience.  Kudos to Tina for helping brighten an otherwise disappointing experience.",Bob J.,"Arlington, VA",3.0 star rating
8/31/2015,5.0 star rating,"The view alone was worth the money. And the money wasn't even a lot. The ribs and the steak were both tender and full of flavor. As we sat and dined during the sunset, we couldn't have asked for a better way to end the night.

Drinks were tasty and strong - were around $12-15 for cocktails, but the entrees were bland and not worth the cost (probably 25-35, which is expected for Whalers Village but the food typically is at least decent). The only reason we went here was because it was the few things on OpenTable on the Kaanapali side that still had reservations available on a Friday night, everything else in the area was packed!!

Then, we ate on the side where you can eat right next to the beach and get more upscale menu items. The view was amazing, but service out there is a little slow because it is separated from the rest of the restaurant. I got poke and flatbread which was just okay.

This is located right along the ocean so while enjoying your breakfast,  coffee,  mimosa, etc you are looking out at the beautiful Pacific Ocean.  
They offer a variety of breakfast items or if you can't decide there is the buffet option.  I always choose the egg white and avocado burrito with fruit because it was outstanding! The burrito was soft and the eggs cooked perfectly with a generous amount of avocado added. Dan would vary between the burrito,  a traditional bacon, eggs, and hashbrown breakfast, or the delicious spicy breakfast tacos. My mom was a traditional breakfast kind of gal, but my dad would do the buffet or the omelet. We all loved whatever we chose and left feeling satisfied. 
The servers were nice but I would say the service was slow most days. If you did not have somewhere to go it was not a big deal but I am sure if you did you woyld be rushed.  Overall we enjoyed each visit and hands down an amazing view!",Denise P.,"Kansas City, MO",3.0 star rating

Every night my husband and I dined at this place and we were lucky enough to come across one of the most hard working and kindest waiters. He went above and beyond to make sure our orders were brought out in timely manner and the quality was good. We came back because of him for the excellent customer service. 

Anson, was amazing. This man deserves a award for his hard woek. The first night we met him they were short staff yet he was giving above acceptional service to all tables. His understanding of the menu and honesty was great. 

Pros: ocean side seating available.
Not crowded=better quality of food. 
Amazing salmon glazed plate
Best steak. 
Yummy iced tea

Cons: I would only say at times the music is loud, really not a big issue but sometimes u just wanna hear the ocean waves and enjoy the nature.

10/23/2015,1.0 star rating,"I don't understand the flavors of the dishes.
I ordered the Salmon and my friend got the Ahi Tuna.
The Salmon had a sweet/ salty glaze and came with a coconut risotto and seaweed salad tasting thing.
The Ahi Tuna came with a very bacon BACON (a lot of bacon) salad and sticky sushi rice. There was a pickled cherry on top of the rice (I don't get the concept).

There was so much going on, if you tried it all at once, you might throw up. The flavors do not go together!

We came here because the restaurants around this location had over an hour wait.
This place had NO wait!!!! Hmm

The location is fantastic and the outdoor seating is beautiful so please fix your menu, maybe you'll get more business. 
Additionally, the Salmon tasted like it just came out of the freezer. For $30+ i expect fresh.

Went here on a walk down kaanipali stopped for the atmosphere for a bite and a few drinks. We ordered edamame and shrimp spring roles. Spring roles (4 pieces) had maybe 2 shrimp total in it. Edamame should be simple and easy it had a sauce similar to barbecue on it with chunks of garlic (I think) and they were soft, not typical of an edamame appetizer. 

I had a house salad which sounded better in the description: avocado (1 slice in it) cherry tomatoes (2 sliced in half). Hubby had ribeye steak with bad tasting sauce and very bland mashed potatoes. 

We should have taken a hint that there was no one there, other restaurants that look more fun are popular for a reason.",Liz N.,"Oak Lawn, IL",3.0 star rating
5/22/2015,5.0 star rating,Relish Oceanside is delicious. We had the artichoke shrimp flatbread to start. My wife devoured it before I could take a picture. The entree was very good and heard 2 other tables next to us order the same Blue Crab & Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi with sweet rice and asparagus. The rice was very flavorful and the Mahi Mahi was maybe best I've had with the blue crab meat on it. It's a tad bit on the pricey side at $36 but that's Maui. And watching the sunset while eating was fantastic. The service was fantastic as my water glass never hit bottom and the waitress always came by with a smile asking us how our meal was.,Jay B.,"San Diego, CA",3.0 star rating
3/28/2016,4.0 star rating,Aaron our waiter was on point. Very friendly and very attentive.  The blue crab crusted Mahi was a **must eat again** dish and would highly recommend it to anyone.

If you weren't staying at the Westin you were put on a waiting list and those staying there (without reservations went ahead of you). When we came back we were seated in a corner. The waitress was just short of being rude to us. Dinner took a half hour to get out to us. The waitress was again very curt and unfriendly. If you want good food, come here, but if you are looking for good service try somewhere else.",Sue W.,"Kahului, HI",3.0 star rating

Food = C- (need lotsa work!)

Seared ahi was way over seasoned - to the point of being inedible 

Ribeye was OK, but the corn was cold and had a weird coating on it. Definitely lose the giant piece of Texas toast...reminded me of Sizzler circa 1976

8/16/2015,3.0 star rating,"We were looking to have a drink to celebrate yet another amazing Maui sunset and decided to grab one of the  miraculously empty oceanfront tables. The wait staff informed us that these tables were reserved for dinner, which seems inflexible--but I get it; these are premium tables indeed. They also seemed very adamant about knowing where we were staying---I am always baffled  by that, because well, your money is good here, right, even when not staying at the Westin? (I am no longer interested in staying at large resorts.) The drinks were average, service below average, and the food was of banquet food quality (think Vegas black-tie fundraiser, or maybe a notch above that). No one expects culinary masterpieces here, but both hubby's steak and my curry were below average. That said, the view was amazing, and it's all about the sunset anyway!",Judy J.,"Las Vegas, NV",3.0 star rating
5/31/2015,1.0 star rating,"Food is mediocre at best and service was extremely bad. We were staying at the Westin and ate here on two separate occasions, one dinner and one brunch. Dinner service was bad and it felt like the staff wanted to go home so they weren't paying attention or remembering our orders. During the brunch,  a bid pooped on my mom's chair and the server didn't even get up and get a napkin. He told my 65 year old mother to walk to the bathroom to clean it. The server was slow and didn't speak English well. Just overall bad.",D T.,"San Francisco, CA",3.0 star rating
6/22/2015,4.0 star rating,"Since there were only 6 reviews to look at before we went, it was with some apprehension.  We wanted a nice oceanside dining experience before our vacation ended and we ended up making a reservation for 6:30.  Oceanside it was, a table for two across the public boardwalk in a small grassy area, right on the beach.  Given that it was 6:30 and the sun was setting, it was understandably bright but beautiful as always in Maui.  
The service which seemed to get 'dinged' in previous reviews was remarkably good.  The hostess seated us promptly and we were greeted and watered immediately by our waiter.  And, the water never got empty as with previous reviews.  Cocktails ordered, one Mai Tai and a Blue Hawaii.  Both were good but as with oceanside resort dining, pricey at $11 each (we just missed happy hour = 5 to 6 PM).  
We started the evening with an appetizer of tofu wraps (which you actually build and wrap yourself) which were served with lettuce, wonderfully lightly fried tofu that had a light crisp crust and side of all sorts of vegetables to add on -- the dipping sauce was a sweet/sour vinegar base and was delicious.  
Wedge salad came next which was fantastic as well though you should order an extra side of dressing. The white anchovies were on the side, which was good because not a big fan o'that fish.
Main course -- Blue Crab & Macadamia nut Mahi Mahi was wonderfully prepared.  Fish was cooked to perfection and the coating way light and not overpowering at all.
Other main course was the Mushroom/Artichoke Pesto Pasta with a serving of fish (Ono?) on top -- not 100% sure of the name but the waiter did indicate that it was recently found to be a warm-blooded fish....?  Any who, I ordered it medium-well and that was my mistake.  It was very good, steak like in texture and taste but the 'well' part made it a bit dry.  The mushroom/artichoke pesto pasta was just OK.  I wouldn't order it again but then I didn't hate it either.  Serving sizes were very good = presentation of the food shows attention to detail but you do get a lot of food for the money.  We wanted dessert but just couldn't do it after the shared appetizer/shared salad, and main courses = sad face, the dessert menu looked wonderful.
All-in-all, beautiful location for a dinner.  After the sunset (awesome) we were treated to a bright Venus with Jupiter in the night sky, minus any moon.  Two cocktails, appetizer, wedge salad, two mains = $130 before tip.  It was well worth the money.
Service was exceptional, location was great --- if you valet your vehicle the restaurant will validate for a three hour stay, that was great perk as well if you know about the parking in Whalers or at the resorts minus validation.

I would recommend and we will go again one day, hopefully sooner than later.",Buck S.,"Phoenix, AZ",3.0 star rating

11/8/2015,3.0 star rating,"Very good ribeye. Perfect view of ocean and even after dark the tiki torches give enough light so that you can see the waves crashing in front of you.  They really rushed us out after closing. They asked what we wanted for dessert while we were all eating or steaks and the desert arrived before we were done eating or meal. We arrived at 9, they close at 10pm and by 10:15 the busboys hovering over us and when we asked, ""do your want us to leave?"" He said ""yes, we closed 15 minutes ago.""  I feel they should be committed to giving full service to anyone they let through the door.

10/28/2015,1.0 star rating,"Our family got together in Maui and stayed at the Westin.  We flew in from California and Japan, so it was definitely a special occasion.  Doubly so because it was a 10 year and 44 year wedding anniversary.   We made reservations for 12 on Oct 26, a Sunday night.  The restaurant didn't seem overly busy, though they were having some type of party towards the back of the restaurant by the bar. 

 I hate giving bad reviews cause I come from the restaurant biz, so know sometimes things are out of the staff's control, but this case goes above and beyond.  And so, here's a 1-star and the reasons why:

1)  One of us made sure to tell the host, manager, and waiter that it was a special occasion celebration and that when dessert was brought to hopefully make some type of special point of it:  'a happy anniversary' note on the cake, some lights, a candle, a celebratory 'congrats!'... anything.  they were ensured that yes, they could do it.   when dessert was brought, nothing was said, dessert was just placed on table.  nothing special.  waiter had to be flagged down, and the only answer was, 'oh we can't do anything special'.... really?!  after your manager and you both just said yes, you'll take care of it? 
2)  After ordering our food, we told the waiter to bring everything all at once without waiting.  we had a few infants and toddlers at the table and couldn't take a drawn out meal.  An entire hour later our entrees arrive.  
3)  I ordered some chicken and spoonbread dish, when it's brought out, I get a bowl of mashed potato.. no explanation, no reason.  again, have to flag down the waiter/server who says, 'oh we ran out of spoonbread, so we're giving mash instead'.  This couldn't have been mentioned sooner, maybe before I ordered it?   Or if it ran out in the interim, how about come out and check if the replacement is OK -- OR, at least say something when you drop it in front of me on the table.    3 service fails in just a single course.  
4)  Food wise, mine was horrible and not simply because I got mash instead of spoonbread.  The chicken was completely overcooked and dry.  the sides were flavorless and underwhelming.  Other people seemed OK with what they ordered, though no one was blown away.  And at the price point this restaurant wants to charge, I think OK does not cut it.  

The one pro I can probably point to is the location on the beach, but then again, there's so many other restaurants along the beach here so why bother w/ this horrible spot. 


Horrendous staff and service.  What was supposed to be a special occasion just turned out to be a dinner, and a horrible one at that.  Service that claims one thing, then completely ignores and does another.   How a top tier resort like Westin can allow service to be this horrible is beyond me.   Barely passable food.  If you're absolutely forced to eat at Westin you might have better luck at the Relish Bistro ( the bar portion ) across the way.   Or better yet, walk a few minutes out of the resort and you'll stumble across a bunch of other places that I'm sure blows this out of the water.

6/21/2015,2.0 star rating,"The food was absolutely delicious and the view spectacular. With that said the service was horrible. We ordered our entrees and dessert at the same time, and didn't receive our food for a long time. Our drinks were never refilled, and we ended up cancelling our desert order and asking for the check because we were waiting with dirty plates for 20 mins for the desert. Then after we were given the check they never came by to take it, which was a problem because we were paying with a card. After waiting at least 10 mins I walked up to the desk with my check and asked them to pay for it now because we wanted to leave. After paying we left, and I would bet it took them another 20 mins to realize we were gone. Never saw our waitress, could have easily dined and ditched because NOBODY was paying attention to us. The terrible service took away from what could have been a very nice night because the food really was good and the sunset view was nice, but I was just too annoyed with the service to have a good time.",Jazzy G.,"Roseville, CA",3.0 star rating

Two star for the bartenders. This review is mainly about the management and hostess. We didn't get to eat 'cuz we waited for 45minutes and received no service at all! Had reservation @715pm. Got there at 7:00pm. Was told by a manager(male, short, w/ accent) I think his name is Stefano to wait in the bar 'cuz table not ready. So, after waiting in the bar for 45mins. I approached the manger and told him we are still waiting for our table. He looked confused and said ""I thought you're gonna be dining in the bar""! Then told the hostess to us in the table. So after seating at the table for 20mins, I approach him again saying we haven't got any service yet. So he told the hostess to get our waiter. So, waited for another 25mins. and no waiter available! So just got up and left. Upon leaving, told the two manager(tall skinny blonde female and Stefano) that we're leaving 'cuz we didn't get any service. And all they said was ""oh sorry"".

7/20/2015,2.0 star rating,"Our last night on Maui and we decided to try Relish Oceanside before we left.  We arrived around 6:30 pm on a Monday night with no reservation and were seated with a beautiful view of the ocean immediately.  Our water was served soon after we sat down but we didn't see our waitress for close to 15 minutes after being seated.  She stopped by the table and told us that she would ""give us time to settle in, and then be back to take our drink orders.""  As if the 15 minutes of settling in wasn't enough to decide what drink we wanted.  A good 45 minutes after being seated our appetizers were served at the same time as our meals; well, three of our meals...the fourth meal wasn't served.  We ate the appetizers and tried to wait for the 4th meal to be delivered but after 15 minutes we started to eat.  35 minutes after the first 3 meals were served and 2 complaints later, our daughter's Crispy Chicken dinner was served.  A manager stopped by and apologized and said that it was our waitress's very first night.  He gave my husband a Mai Thai on the house and then also comped our daughter's dinner.  The meal ended up taking 2+ hours due to the service.  In the over two hours we were there, our waitress never stopped back by to ask if we wanted any more drinks and our water wasn't refilled until after we had completely finished our meals.",kris a.,"Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA",3.0 star rating
