9/26/2017,5.0 star rating,"If you're staying in the Kaanapali area, this is a great spot. You can't beat the location - just steps from the beach and the ocean. It is typically very crowded, so you might have a wait. I believe they take reservations though. I ordered the Maui Onion, Walnut and Feta salad - but whoops, I'm an onion hater so they held the onions for me. I know, I'm a terrible person! The salad was scrumptious, something not often said about salads I order. I especially liked the fresh strawberries on it. 

Service is generally good, but can be on the slow side if your server is really slammed. Just get yourself into island time, enjoy the ocean breezes and don't let it bother you. I like to come back to Leilani's every chance I can get.",Christine B.,"Mesa, AZ",4.0 star rating
9/11/2017,5.0 star rating,"We had dinner there last night. We where not asked if we wanted to be upstairs or down stairs. Evidently two different menus, upstairs is more of a dinner menu and down stairs is more casual like could be a lunch menu. We were seated downstairs and happy to be seated after 25 minutes, they were busy and we didn't have reservation. We decided to eat here based on the menu that was offered upstairs. We had a great waiter and he brought us the menu from upstairs after I asked if this was the lunch menu. Lol.
Any way we ordered the seafood pasta, it was excellent with lobster, prawns, fish and scallops. The sauce was so good.
It's a good size dish my wife almost couldn't finish. We  will go back and have again before we leave.",Don H.,"Newman, CA",4.0 star rating
9/10/2017,3.0 star rating,"Meh... don't get the high ratings for anything other than the view. I was seated on the side of the building so I didn't even have that. 

I got the chef's tasting menu, with prawns and catch of the day: moon fish. The food was very mediocre and the mai tai was weak. What stood out is that the server was really friendly (Mark,  I think), he asked all about my vacation, and at least pretended to be engaged. As a solo traveler I appreciated being able to share my story. 

Did not realize until I got a card upon leaving, but this place is owned by the same company as Duke's, Kimos, and Hula Grill next door.",Sarah B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating

So overall we really like this place and if we ever come across one again we will definitely eat here for sure.

I would suggest the Mai Tai and the Long Island's for drinks and the fresh fish is definitely really good you can't beat it. I also ordered the crab cakes with which I think are the best crab cakes I've ever had anywhere really good.

9/13/2017,5.0 star rating,"Loved this restaurant! And the food was amazing.  The place was very busy when we got there for dinner around 8pm Saturday night,  the wait was about 40 mins .  We just walked around and shopped a little while we waited. The restaurant is very spacious and it is two stories and water front.  It wad dark so we couldn't see the water, but we could hear the waves when the live music had intermission.  I had the Kona fish and it was truly delicious.  I don't remember what my companion ate, I was too busy enjoying my food! Lol. Yes, I would recommend this place.",Jaire Q.,"Houston, TX",4.0 star rating
7/20/2017,5.0 star rating,"We stayed at the Sheraton so Leilani's was a short walk. I can't remember how many times we went to Leilani's On the Beach for food and/or drinks, at least 5 times during our stay. The customer service is always on point.

We had to wait about 20 minutes the first time, maybe 15 minutes once, but the other times, they got us in right away. The food is good, our favorite was the sriracha-guava glazed wings. Wow those were perfectly delicious. The fries are also perfect. We also tried, the tacos, cuban sandwich, korean chicken sandwich, etc.  All were good.

Now, the Anuenue drink became our favorite drink EVER.  So perfect, our favorite flavors. Not to mention, it's a pretty drink :)  We ordered it every time.",Amy K.,"Omaha, NE",4.0 star rating
7/19/2017,4.0 star rating,"If you're staying at one of the resorts in this area , this is a good choice if you're looking for a family restaurant. 
The location is right on the beach, next to whalers village. It's not a fancy place, more like a simple beach restaurant. 
They have a good drinks menu, with a decent selection of both red and white wine. Service is very good, quick, efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. The food selection is good, they serve typical comfort food and some Hawaiian inspired dishes. My favorite appetizers include the popcorn shrimp and the nachos. The Caesar salad is fresh and crisp, with the right amount of dressing. The quality of the food is very good, I'd come back on any day. 
Just make sure to bring some time, especially for dinner. They don't take reservations, it's walk in only. They'll give you a buzzer, so you can still walk around the area.",Hans C.,Hong Kong,4.0 star rating
9/4/2017,4.0 star rating,"Great food, service and views. Portion sizes leave something to be desired but I can respect quality over quantity. We shared the kula veggies, poke bowl and fish tacos. The kula veggies were served over macadamia nut hummus (lemony garlic and nutty tasting). The fish tacos had avocado cabbage and a chipotle sauce. The poke was served with taro chips, cabbage and avocado cubes. Everything tasted great and we were able to enjoy beachfront views and live music.",Ian M.,"Arlington, VA",4.0 star rating
9/2/2017,4.0 star rating,"We came here for my girlfriend's birthday, making a reservation for it the day before. I asked for a table with a view of the sunset if it was possible and they were able to accommodate! The view really contributed to making dinner special.

Our server was very friendly and attentive, the drinks were delicious, and the food was all very good. I can't say that I've found myself craving anything I had at Leilani's after eating here, though dessert especially was wonderful, but it really was a treat.

To get here, we took a shuttle from our resort to the shopping area that Leilani's is a part of. The shopping around here is good entertainment if you arrive a little earlier than expected like we did or if you want to walk around a little bit after your meal like we did.",Maung A.,"Madison, WI",4.0 star rating
6/25/2017,3.0 star rating,"3 1/2 stars 

Decided to check this place out due to the reviews from other yelpers.

MAKE A RESERVATION!  This busy Whalers Village restaurant gets packed since it's right on the busy walk path.   I made a reservation thru OpenTable.   Showed up 20 min early and was seated about 5 min after we arrived.  I heard others being told an hour wait.

There is a second check in counter for walk ups.  

This restaurant has two levels so ask for the second level for best view.  We were seated by black rock side.

Pupus (appetizers for us East coast folks)
Jumbo lump crab cakes. - We definitely have a different definition of ""Jumbo"".  The two cakes were small and just  ""OK"" to me. 

Fresh Salad - Local tomato and fresh mozzarella - To me it was just ok.  VERY small portion on a large plate

Dinner
Hubby had the SESAME CRUSTED AHI* STEAK which was Coconut & citrus jasmine rice, shiitake-soy butter, grilled Kula asparagus.  He REALLY enjoyed it and is best eaten rare almost like sashimi 
Me - PARMESAN CRUSTED Mahi Mahi -Fresh herbs, lemon-caper reduction, farmer's market vegetables. LOVED this dinner.  The vegges were carrots and green pepper al dente.   
Kid had grilled chicken and french fries which he enjoyed

Dessert
We had to try the Kimo's hula pie since it was recommend by friends. So glad we did as the personalized plate had a large piece of hula pie.    Ours had a Chocolate cookie crust, ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream.  We skipped the nuts and it came with homemade caramel topping.

The ocean view at this place is amazing.  we had a view of the black rock which was great as we could see the sun set.

The waitress was really nice and friendly.

So if we go back we would skip the appetizers as they felt super small and super expensive.
Dinner was very tasty and so worth the $$.  Dessert was also amazing.",Cindy M.,"Lansdowne, PA",4.0 star rating
7/6/2017,3.0 star rating,"This place was  good. Want here for our last night on Maui with my partner and their parents. I had the seafood pasta, which was good. Just and FYI, it only had two prawns, 1/2 of a small lobster tail and a lot of fish that tasted like chicken. That's one of the reasons for the 3 stars...Thought it would have more of a variety of seafood. 

My partner and dad had the steak, they seem to enjoy it... I wish I would of have gotten that instead, it looked good. I had an opportunity to taste it and it was pretty good.  My partner's mom had the scallops. She had to send it back because it was too grainy. (The second reason for the 3 stars)The manager was kind though, they compensated us. 
I'd give this a 3&1/2 if Yelp would allow it...

Now for the drinks, the waitress recommended the lava flow or something of that sort. My partner we and her dad ordered a couple they couldn't tasted the alcohol, so they had to order a shot on the side...

Finally, the hula pie... it is a must have! Ask for a to-go container right away and put the 1/2 of your food and there because you are going to want to make room for it. They are huge... you can easily share one with four people. 

Overall, it was a pretty good place. I'd give it another try... with another dish....maybe the steak..",Caren F.,"Sacramento, CA",4.0 star rating

9/24/2017,5.0 star rating,"This is probably one of my top 3 restaurants in Maui. It is very popular, so it's hard to get a good table with a view, but we are never disappointed every time we come here. The food, the service, the ambiance are all there, and it is a good bonus if we get a good table during sunset.",Ralph J.,"Altadena, CA",4.0 star rating
5/17/2017,3.0 star rating,"The views from the oceanside table are amazing, but the food is sub par. Drinks were OK. We started with the crab cakes which were mediocre. For the mains we had the parmesan crusted Mahi Mahi which was bad. The fish was OK but the greens were bland and the mash had lumps of potato in the them along with potato skins and was extremely salty. We had the hula pie for dessert which was good and earned the stars for this review. 
The servers were good and friendly and were apologetic for the food quality. They offered alternatives, but I'd lost my appetite by then. 
This place seems like a tourist trap, would recommend going down to Lahaina to have a much better meal at any place there.",Leon L.,"Redwood City, CA",4.0 star rating

Food: my boyfriend got the sesame seed crusted lightly sear ahi tuna and I highly suggest it! So much flavor, it was perfectly cooked! And had the distinctive ahi taste. I on the other had got the flat iron medium rare steak. It came with green beans and carrots with a side of bacon mashed potatoes. The steak was juicy and very flavorful!

9/26/2017,1.0 star rating,We had lunch and everything was so so. I have to have gluten free and I had a gluten free salad nothing was very special on the menu nothing stood out by my stomach hurt afterwards. The salad lettuce was kind of wilted. I didn't care much for the dressing in flavor. The strawberries were not crisp. It tasted like an old salad. My sons chicken strips were fried boneless chicken thighs dark cheap meat not white meat. The fries were likely frozen and not fresh. It looked pretty but it was not worth the money,Lisa C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4.0 star rating
9/28/2017,3.0 star rating,So I went here this afternoon for lunch and i expected much better food due to reading the reviews on yelp beforehand. I was quite disappointed with my fish tacos.

7/27/2017,3.0 star rating,"The service was good, quick. The drinks were tasty. The food was mediocre. For about $18, the poke barely had anything. You can go to a whole in the wall restaurant and get so much more bang for your buck. The calamari was decent, but you can't really mess that up. They served it with cocktail sauce, which was just okay. I would have preferred marinara or some creamier sauce. I don't really recommend coming here. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that are more affordable and tastier. 

You pretty much are paying for the view.",Katherine D.,"Northridge, Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
9/26/2017,4.0 star rating,Whats not to like. We travel to Hawaii every year and we try to venture out to find the best cuisine and at Leilani's we were not disappointed. The service was top notch and from the hors d'oeuvres to the main dish everything was quality and flavorful. Along with the meal came ambiance of the beach and a sunset.

4/26/2017,4.0 star rating,"Coming here for dinner at sunset is a special treat. Craig was our waiter who is fun, attentive, and charming. The top balcony over looking the water is a great and romantic spot to be. During the hours around 3-5 ish they also have live music going on which is nice.
Our table for dinner had crab cakes (5/5), crab legs 4/5, mahi mahi and the Opah fish which were all pretty tasty but the fish was a little dry. The Hula Pie for dessert is an absolute must!!!

9/9/2017,4.0 star rating,"This is for my visit in early August 2017. I actually made a lunch order for take out first time (their fish tacos are super yummy!) to eat in my room before finally coming in to dine there. I was fortunate to be able to squeeze a reservation for party of 2 during Leilani's busiest hours at 5:45 pm via phone call. Yelpers, before you fret about not being able to reserve the time you want on OpenTable on a late notice, CALL THE RESTAURANT FIRST. I was in that state with a hangry partner and no desire at all to drive out again from our hotel. I was grateful to be able to get that slim timing! 

After a walk over from Westin, we were greeted promptly and were directed to the upper floors of Leilani's. We got a nice view of the beach, and the staff did their best to situate our seating better in the tiny space. We got the Pan-Seared Catch and one of their seafood specials, which were all delicious and exquisite. Our evening ended with a nice walk back to our hotel and catching the sunset view. 

I was bummed out about not being able to do the Tasting Menu, which I hope to try to go for if I ever visit Maui again! Touristy or not (yes the prices are scary), Leilani's is worth the visit (even more so with a reservation made ahead of time)!",Melody W.,"Honolulu, HI",4.0 star rating

7/3/2017,4.0 star rating,"One of my last family meals here was at Leilani's, and it was a super fun dinner event. 

As an appetizer, I shared some crab cakes with my 3 cousins and it was super succulent and just overall delicious. If you've ever been to Maryland, these crab cakes are pretty comparable to theirs. 

I had the Pan Roasted All Natural Chicken that came with ratatouille, and that was the best part of it! The chicken was succulent, but the ratatouille held all the flavor. I truly miss it and would order it again in a heartbeat. 

For dessert, I shared a mud pie with 3 of my cousins and it was super good. Bonus: I had to use force to break the crust which made it even more appealing because I had to work for it in a sense and couldn't just whip it up with my spoon. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet too! 

TLDR: If you're looking to have a nice meal with good company, I'd recommend Leilani's!",Jennifer T.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating
2/27/2017,5.0 star rating,"Pono pie! Leilani's is one of the restaurants in Hawaii where you can get this very special treat not available on the mainland. How special is it? It's gluten free, (added) sugar free, dairy free...and looks and tastes almost like a fruity cheesecake!

We were introduced to pono pie at Leilani's and it was easily the best and most unique thing we ate on our recent Hawaii trip. Made from breadfruit and blended with other fruit it tasted like a lilikoi (passion fruit) and coconut cake. Still cannot believe how delicious this dessert was and that it was just made with local fruits!

The pono pie ($10) was the perfect end to an awesome dinner we had at Leilani's which included attentive and friendly service, tasty and affordable entrees (sitting in the more casual beach bar patio) and outstanding tropical cocktails bursting with the flavors of fresh fruit juices. I wish we had been there for sunset, during happy hour, not just because of the deals, but because you can get a perfect view of the sun dropping between the Lanai and Molokai islands from the beach side patio.

At Leilani's you have a choice between the outdoor covered beach bar patio right on Ka'anapali Beach and tucked away indoor dining room. They each have different menus and I totally recommend doing the beach bar which has a separate hostess and entrance. The inside dining room has fancier entrees for around $30 and up like prime rib and steak, while the beach bar has more casual items like burgers and tacos for around $20 or less.

I found the beach bar menu to be a LOT more affordable without sacrificing choices. We got a poke bowl ($18) that came with tons of housemade taro chips and was the best poke we had on our Hawaii trip -- nice and red, perfectly marinaded! I ordered the ""fish of the day,"" which seemed like a bargain at $23 as the fish happened to be opah, Hawaiian moon fish, and was balanced nicely atop a bed of veggies and potatoes and sauce. It felt like a big fancy entree I would have gotten inside without the big fancy price.

Our cocktails were outstanding! I really will miss that robust fruit flavor from freshly squeezed juices that makes it so you can barely taste the alcohol in your mai tai ($12). We also got the coconut grove ($10), which was like a pina colada with added macadamia nuts blended in for added dimension.

6/30/2017,3.0 star rating,"Killer view right next to Whaler's village and all the beach goers along Ka'anapali beach. The food was just okay and their menu carries the standard resort burgers, nachos and seafood. Their appetizer beachside nachos (13$) were pretty meh, with not enough guac. The ahi poke bowl (18$) was crazy loaded on saltiness.. not even balanceable with the taro chips. The fresh fish tacos (19$) were the slightly more redeeming part of the meal, with super fresh large slabs of mystery fish (they don't tell you what it is). The famous hula pie (10$) was more like an ice cream cake covered with chocolate and whipped cream.

Nachos could have been amazing, but due to the way they are prepared were served barely warm (cold in spots). Kids meal is ok. If you have a fish intolerant little one, be warned the chicken strips may be a bit fishy because of shared frying with fish. Overall, it was on par with a quick casual Applebee's/ Friday's style restaurant, but with a nice beach view. Salad had dressing left off and soup had same coolness as nachos.  Maybe this place is just too cool for us LOL. Best part, quick seating, attentive service and they genuinely seemed to care and take action when we explained our food shortcomings.

Both good but tuna a little more moist. Didn't like fish tacos bc the taste reminded me of tilapia. The tacos could have also used some more crunch like with slaw or something. Our waitress Jessica was great. 

Went back for the chef's tasting for $26 around 5pm and got seated promptly. The tiger shrimp appetizer was just large shrimp with cocktail sauce. Kulua pork spring rolls were nice and crunchy. The parmesan crusted moon fish was freaking delicious. Surf and turf was good too but not as good as the fish. Good bread pudding.",Kenneth H.,"Arcadia, CA",4.0 star rating
8/22/2017,4.0 star rating,"Came here for dinner and would definitely recommend!

Food: The food came out at a great pace and was very tasty. We ordered the sashimi as an appetizer - absolutely delicious! Very tender and great flavor. I ordered the parm crusted fish, which was a great sized portion and very tasty. I also sampled the food of the others at my table - I recommend the seafood pasta as well as the flat iron steak. Perfectly cooked (we ordered medium rare). 

Service: absolutely great! The hostess was very friendly and helped us to be seated earlier than our reservation. Our server (I believe his name was John) was very attentive. 

Drinks: The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the drinks were pretty average. We sent back the coconut grove - the entire table agreed it was not good. In my opinion, it tasted like the buttered popcorn jelly bean. Despite the bad drink, John was extremely understanding and got us new drinks right away. 
I had the Lei's lemonade, which seemed a bit weak. We had another tropical drink (anuenue I think?) and it was very tasty, but also not very strong.

Ambiance: Pretty on the inside. I hear there is a great view, but we came at about 9 PM, so it was dark.

Visiting from California and was in that area looking for a place to watch my football.  Went to the patio area and asked a server if the games would be on their TV's eventually, as they appeared to be just setting up.

Her response was brief and not a friendly note to it-- ""It will be on but not with sound or anything....we're not a sports bar"".  I took a second to process that and before I could ask another question she said ""why don't you try one of the hotels?"" in a very snippy tone.

The location is right next to the water and we were seated upstairs on the second floor. We had a beautiful view of the water and watched the sunset while we enjoyed dinner. Be prepared for bugs! I don't know if it's just this area but the flys were all over our table and along the fence we sat next to. I ordered their herb roasted fish of the day with watercress pesto. Laid over a bed of poached baby potatoes, baby carrots and toasted macadamia nuts. BF ordered their pan seared catch with kula corn, local greens, sweet potato gnocchi and charred tomato vinaigrette. I enjoyed my fish of the day. It was a very mild white fish. It was good but nothing to write home about. I did enjoy the sweet potato gnocchi. But overall I think my BF and I would both agree the best part of the meal was dessert. We had their Kimo's original Hula Pie. Let me describe this extremely decadent dessert. It has a chocolate cookie crust, MACADAMIA NUT ICE CREAM, pool of hot fudge,toasted macadamia nuts and whip cream to finish it all off. WOW! It was heavenly!

12/15/2016,5.0 star rating,"An awesome surprise welcomed us about Leilani's. Who knew? Behind all that busy exterior is this truly romantic area in the back. 

I know the area where this restaurant is located and I never thought romance is there for you to have. It's this little spot where about eight tables and a tiki torch is so well arranged. The table we had backed into a wall where there was some really noisy birds. No it's not a bad noise. It's very appealing! 

But here's a tip. Request for the table right under the tiki torch. Best table. This little spot if you request is described as ""on the side"". It is NOT the upper level. 

Leilani's is located in the Whalers Village. Next to Louis Vuitton. 

Great food. Awesome service. A standout was their Ahi Poke. The tuna steak is outstanding as well.

8/12/2017,5.0 star rating,"The beachfront restaurant at Whaler's Village offers delicious dinner choices in a family atmosphere. 

First, let's talk restaurant choice. The downstairs restaurant offers more casual food, such as burgers, tacos and pasta. I assume that this is designed to create higher turnover of the outdoor space on the ground level, as well as to indent this looking for more substantial fare to choose the upstairs dining room. 

We ate in the main restaurant upstairs. We arrived after nine on a Friday night and were seated on the outdoor balcony along the rail. Excellent location for a table. The setting was warm and breezy and the clear sky was decorated with bright stars. 

The food was excellent. We started by sharing a Caesar salad; it was sizable enough to share as a way to pass the time until our meal came. For our main course, we ordered ahi tuna rare in a butter sauce (it is one of the standard fish preparations they offer daily) that was delicious. It was served with asparagus and basmati rice. The rice was somewhat bland even with the butter sauce dressing it, but everything else was amazing. We also ordered the Maui-onion flatiron steak. The steak was seasoned perfectly with a dash of salt and was served over delicious mashed potatoes with bacon. Mixed vegetables were also very good (broccoli and carrots). 

Overall, this quality of food was excellent and the location stunning. Definitely find time to try this gem on Kaanapali beach.",Bill W.,"Syosset, NY",4.0 star rating
4/22/2017,3.0 star rating,"Ka'anapali's Whaler's Village offers a few good choices for a meal. And by and large, they're all comparable because they all cater to tourists. As a result, you will find large menus with a lot to choices including several kid friendly options, lots of ""island flair,"" and a long list of fruity cocktails with umbrellas and/or tiki heads. But among all your restaurant choices, only two places are right along the beach walk. The more renowned and popular Hula Grill, and Lealani's. And while neither is perfect, Lealani's is pretty much everyone's second choice. Most people dine here when they can't get into Hula Grill, or becuase they already ate at Hula and want something else. Both establishments have a fine dining area, and a bar and grill. Both are reliably crowded for dinner, and both take reservations which I highly recommend.

Many people rave about place and give it five stars. I would suggest they're grading on a curve. Because Maui's many better restaurants are far away. At least for most people who have spent their day lazing on the beach and don't want to venture too far from their hotel. So yeah, Leilani's is fine. And good enough when you're wearing guava shaded glasses because you're in Hawaii and dining by the beach.

10/8/2016,4.0 star rating,"This place was good and I'm glad we stopped in here! We were wandering around the beach walk looking for a place to eat after a long day on the road to Hana. We came across Leilani's which is like right next door to our hotel and decided to eat here.

We ordered a shrimp cocktail for the appetizer which was good. Then I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the prime rib. Both were very good and we enjoyed our dinners. 

The only drawback for mine was this weird tasting wine (?) pepper sauce that was under my mashed potatoes. The filet was perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth tender but then all of a sudden you would accidentally get a taste of that horrible inedible sauce and it would ruin the bite you just took. I don't know if someone liked this sauce before but I don't know how someone can! I actually couldn't even eat the potatoes because they were swimming in it. I was able to eat around it though which was a plus. My husband liked his dinner but complained that he did have au ju sauce to dip his meat in.

Our waitress, who was very sweet, talked us into ordering the hula pie, which they are famous for, and I am glad we did because this was the best part of the dinner and the reason for the fourth star! We got the strawberry special pie and it was fantastic! 

We definitely enjoyed ourselves here and would recommend it to others.",Megan E.,"West Orange, NJ",4.0 star rating

Maybe was an off day. I thought the chop chop kale salad was fantastic. Only $11 and it was quite good.

I would have to say, first off, this is my favorite place for Hula Pies. I personally like the Hula Pie without whipped cream, as this tends to dilute the ice cream and hot fudge. Just hop over to the bar and order a drink and dessert, or take it to go!

I like the dinner menu over the lunch. I would skip the appetizers to save room for a Hula Pie and just have a fish entree. This can be a parmesan crusted or nut/panko crusted are great.

We skipped the pupu's and went straight for the entree's.  My opah was delightful, and all the other meals (all fish) were exceptional.  Even our picky eater enjoyed his seafood pasta medley.

It was a great welcome to Maui dinner!",John S.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4.0 star rating
4/7/2017,5.0 star rating,"Leilani's (on the beach) was definitely one of our favorite dining experiences during our Maui vacation. We originally made a dinner reservation in the dining room for the ""fine dining"", but later that night we decided that we were hungry earlier than our reservation and really wanted to eat on the beach patio which housed their more fun and casual menu, so we canceled our reservation and waited for beach side.

The wait was long, no doubt about that. On a weekday we were quoted about 1.5 hours and it really was right about 1.5 hours, but the perfect beach patio and simple menu were worth the wait. 

Once seated it was here at Leilani's that we had the BEST DRINK of our entire vacation, the Coconut Grove which has an amazing macadamia nut liqueur. It was served blended, which was delicious, but on the second round I decided I wanted to try it just over ice and they were happy to oblige. The drink was JUST as good over ice, so don't be swayed not to try it if you're not a blended drink lover...it was AMAZING and definitely one of the top 3 ""hits"" of the trip! Later my husband tried the Lime in the Coconut drink and while it was good, it didn't hold a candle to the Coconut Grove!

For appetizers we indulged in the coconut shrimp and sriracha guava chicken wings and both were stellar! The sauce on the wings was delicious and the crust on the shrimp was amazing! Personally, I can 100% say that the drinks and apps. were the highlights of my meal. That's not to say that my entree wasn't good, but the drinks and apps. were better!

For my entree I got the Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was definitely interesting. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but there just wasn't a TON of flavor to the dish itself. My husband got the fresh fish catch of the day and unfortunately since I'm writing this review several weeks later, we have forgotten what the actual fish was. We remembered that he enjoyed his dish though!

We didn't end up ordering dessert because the Coconut Groves may just as well have been desserts.

8/31/2016,5.0 star rating,"Leilani's is definitely our go-to dinner date spot. The bartenders and staff are always friendly, the food and drinks are top notch, and a no-brainer stop when you're walking around Whaler's Village, whether you want a quick beverage, done good eats, or a hankering for a hula pie. 

We've opted for both the bar and outdoor bar seating - we live down the road so we frequent the area often, and always bring family and friend here when they visit from out of town. Great thing about sitting at the bar is that you can also order the dinner menu, and the bartenders are always super attentive and great with their timing between beverages and each course - sometimes they're so ninja you can't even tell you've gone through an entire bottle of wine by yourself (guilty)! If you're into wine, they offer great pricing on bottles - way more value to get a bottle than to just get a glass! If you're a cocktail drinker, they have a great selection with fresher options than some of their counterparts on the Ka'anapali strip - my favorite is the Ginger Hoku!

Some of our food favorites include the prime rib (paniolo style, which is like a kick of Cajun greatness), seafood pasta, kale salad, poke and taro chips, lamb sliders, sriracha wings, and pono pie. And you're crazy if you don't ask what the seasonal hula pie is every time you visit - if you're a fan of the TS restaurant chain, you know Maui restaurants do the seasonal hula pie right! 

This time around we sat at Maggie's side of the bar - she is so great and definitively knows what she's doing! We couldn't have asked for a more perfect dinner (it was date night for us - living in Maui couples don't get too many of these when you both work in hospitality like we do). Maggie was super accommodating and knew just when to pour another glass of wine :) Shout out to Jimmy, Chehee (sp?!), Carson, and all the other staff who always shows aloha when we come hang out at Lei's!

The hostess was very kind in greeting us and wished us a happy anniversary. Seated at an awesome table on the patio with a great view. First impressions were great. The lime in the coconut drink was awesome and refreshing. The server was kind and accommodating. My 2 stars go there!  Fish tacos were not on the menu. I ordered a bottle wine and it came out tasting very tart and like vinegar. They took it back and brought me another. Same concern. I decided to upgrade to a bottle that I knew would be good and I've had multiple times at home and in many restaurants. Same issue. I tried to drink it thinking it would get better. It did not and I had to send it back. The manage came out and was very nice about it but 3 strikes I was done. Opted for water. 

Then we ordered their special medium porter house and pan seared fish. Both came out way over cooked. Due to our wine issue we just ate what we could and called it night. 

The table next to us was apparently celebrating their anniversary too. Our same waitress offered them an anniversary dessert and wished them well. Then she came to our table to remove our plates and asked if we wanted dessert, we declined. Was disappointing to hear her offer the other couple a dessert and not us. While we still would have declined based off our meal experience, should have been handled the same. 

While the waitress was kind and accommodating. The food was over cooked and they seem to have a poor batch of wine.

It was within walking distance from our hotel when you took the walking trail that runs along Ka'anapali Beach.

So when we got seated at Leilani's with a gorgeous view of the ocean, and a mai tai for him (he tried mai tais at every restaurant as they all claimed to be the best), we were happy. For dinner that night, we ordered the Hawaiian ahi poke (I love that dish, I wish it were possible to get inland) and a burger (I just really wanted a burger). Both were delicious and we were stuffed - the prices are typical for Hawaii, but so are the portions; you rarely leave any place hungry here.

I was particularly happy to see Racer 5 IPA on their drinks list, from Bear Republic in California, which is one of my favorite beers and can be hard to find.

The place seemed to have some difference in environments between the sides of the patio, the upstairs dining room, and a few other nooks - the experience depended on where you sat.

12/22/2016,4.0 star rating,"Like the Hula Grill next door, Leilani's has both a formal restaurant and dining room and a casual, outdoor beachside bar and grill. And unlike so many other places of this genre, that beachside grill is unusually tasty. Indeed, I think I need a name for this genre of place -- the kind of place that's not too fancy, and yet basically everything is just a bit better than you'd have any right to expect; the kind of place that makes you happy, and then makes you cry with just a little bit of rage that this kind of place is so rare.

The miso-kale salad was satisfying, and tasty in the kind of way that makes you want to inhale large quantities of raw kale and broccoli.  The poke was good, and cleverly served with a bed of taro chips for perfect snacking and sharing.  The nachos were nice, with good guacamole and a generous serving of kahlua pork.  And the coconut shrimp were plump, flavorful, and had an unusually tasty dipping sauce. 

You get the idea.  None of this was mind-blowingly creative, but by the end of the meal, very full and very happy, we couldn't shake the feeling that somebody in the kitchen was taking an unusual measure of pride in their work. Indeed, I think I have eaten dinner in this restaurant more times than anywhere else on the island of Maui -- and I would be perfectly happy if that trend continues.",William B.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating

Sitting outside and watching sunset, our family had a pleasant dinner here a few days ago. Their food and drinks were all on par. Covered by black and white sesame on the top and bottom, their ahi steak was fresh and seared raw inside. The shrimp cocktail was seasoned and grilled, pairing well with the sauce with a hint of spiciness. Such a great place to relax and chill!",Yuhuan T.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

6/8/2016,2.0 star rating,"We walked here one night from the Hyatt.  The wait around 7pm was about 45 mins.  We waited (of course) because we didn't know what else we want for dinner. We ended up ordering Fish tacos and Korean fried chicken sandwich.  

The fish tacos were good but the Korean fried chicken sandwich was nothing but BATTERED. It was oily and gross to be honest. There was barely any chicken.  We also order Hula Pie which was probably the best thing I ate for that particular dinner.

I probably will not return for dinner or lunch but for Hula Pie",Patrina C.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating
7/6/2016,4.0 star rating,"Sat on the patio during Aloha hour (happy hour) and only ordered the potstickers off the HH menu, but they were the best food choice out of everything we ordered!
Got the fish tacos because of the reviews raving about them but they were just ok - the fish was a little dry and instead of eating the whole taco ended up just eating the fish. I would skip these. 
Also got the ahi poke chips - and again just picked out the poke and didn't eat the chips (they were just a cheap filler and didn't want to fill up on them). 
Calamari was decent, they were the strips and not the rings. Neutral on them. 
The atmosphere was mostly why I liked the place so much. Right on the beach and the live music during aloha hour was really nice and relaxing. And definitely WAY better than Hula Grill right next door.",Lani L.,"Scottsdale, AZ",4.0 star rating

We walked past Leilani's on a stroll after spending the entire day oscillating between ocean and pool sides. Upon glancing at the outdoor menu we decided that Leilani's it is. We ordered the ono, mahi-mahi, scallops and a fish I'd never heard of (can't even recall its name). They were each prepared in traditional methods (Parmesan crusted, pan seared, etc) but the fish was so fresh that its flavor came front and center. The accompaniments were average (mashed potatoes and vegetables). Nothing stand out-ish about it other than the fish was delicious. Dessert was apple bread pudding which I found rather dense in texture but it was tasty and we also shared a molten chocolate lava cake which was also good.

9/1/2017,1.0 star rating,"After visiting this restaurant twice - I think I can give unbiased review. 

First lunch was good, nice view and ok food. Nice staff. Their coconut shrimp was pretty nice. So we decided to try their dinner.

Dinner was pretty terrible as you can see my rating. We ordered several dishes to share and few glasses of wine. 

Their chicken wing was undercooked, salad was overly seasoned and service was terrible. And overly priced for what it is...when we had one bite into the chicken we found it's still pink inside and bone was pink - we asked the waitress and she basically said that's how they cook the chicken.

I mean I do eat my beef medium rare not chicken, it was totally UNDERCOOKED! Instead of accommodating our concerns, she just walked away. 

It is very unfortunate experience because we had much better service previously. And I do not want to recommend this restaurant for health concerns if that's REALLY how they cook their bone-in chicken in pink color.",Sunhye M.,"Long Island City, NY",4.0 star rating
8/24/2017,1.0 star rating,"Chicken wings - pink, gross!  Mother in law ordered Opa, which was a special and an entree - they refused to serve it with the other entrees and insisted that it be served as an appetizer.   Perhaps because they had already cooked it - it was dry and cold!  Gross!  I had a Korean fried chicken sandwich - two pieces of unseasoned chicken stacked and dripping with grease, then mashed together with some kimchi they bought at the store.  Spring rolls for an app - ended up being fried, dripping with grease.   Waitress was nice, she had little to work with.  Food has really dropped off here.  Nasty!

Oh and I almost forgot - our waitress never offered us water.  Poor caddying!

Update - my wife just threw up about a half hour after leaving.  Probably from the undercooked chicken wings, but it's anybody's guess.

I remember thinking I could've done without the rice, but it was good when I ate it with the sauce. The rest of my party also enjoyed their food.

Nothing is cheap in this area and the cost might be a tad high but not outrageous.  The quality of the food is first rate and I thought it was well presented.  They ran out of the fish I was interested in for dinner and it was only ~7 pm which was concerning; they tried to accomodate my needs.  They were fantastic with allergies.

However, it is the location that makes this restaurant special in my thinking.  It is right on the beach and with quality food it doesn't get more relaxing that this.

So there is a formal restaurant and a casual restaurant that's out in the patio so you can dine with a view of the ocean and sunset :)

We headed in over to the causal section, which was great because there was no wait! We ordered this delicious cocktail made with coconut water. Don't remember the name but it was just as light and refreshing as it sounds. On the menu it said that they had award winning fish tacos so I went ahead and ordered the FISH TACOS!!

There was a good sized fillet in each tortilla and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Almost blackened. With a fresh slaw and cheddar cheese. CHEESE! They also had a great house made salsa to accompany the tacos. So so good!!! 

We also had to order the hula pie, but we didn't go for traditional. We ordered the SMORES HULA PIE with gram cracker crust, chocolate ice cream, and gooey marshmallow on top. Yum yum yum.

The fish tacos were dry and over cooked. The fish tacos at down the hatch in downtown Lahaina were eons better! 

The coconut shrimp were good, though I think I preferred Joeys Kitchen which had more coconut and batter. The onions rings here were solid and delicious though! The spicy mustard the onions rings with does my go at all together! Do yourself a favor and ask for a side of ranch to go with the crispy rings!

We ordered the tomato and mozzarella appetizer, it was good, but nothing exceptional. My sirloin was a little over cooked, but not enough to complain about, potatoes were definitely over seasoned, especially with all the salty bacon  on them. My husband's tuna was okay, definitely not the worst, nor the best. 

Our server was polite and reasonably prompt. He spent a lot of time at the table beside ours, but that customer was quite the  wind-bag so that was understandable. 

Overall it was an okay meal, not bad, but not the best bang for our buck. Could have gotten a much better meal at Star Noodle or somewhere else for half the price. I would try the patio area as the menu there looked more interesting, but not the upstairs dining room.

We started with the Maui Farmer's salad and I am still dreaming about the goat cheese -- so creamy and delicious. We also had the Pork Spring Rolls, which were also very tasty.

For our main courses, I really struggled to choose, but ended up picking the Korean Chicken Sandwich. It was really delicious with lots of complimentary flavors, My husband had the fish tacos, which I had a bite of and were also very good.

For desert, we had the hula pie, which is basically the largest slice of ice cream cake you've ever seen. It was amazing and the perfect way to finish a meal!

8/20/2016,1.0 star rating,"Everything was so salty leaving my party and I feeling salty as well, urban Dictionary that word if you don't catch my obvious drift. 

Food: Our server promptly brought out drinks and sourdough bread/butter, compliments of the restaurant. The bread was warm on the inside, fresh and yes very salty. I had the pan seared catch featuring freshly caught Ono. My fish was really subtle, firm, fresh and not as fatty as other fish. It was served over a bed of deliciously crafted sweet potato gnocchi, corn/green bean medley and a savory tomato vinaigrette. As much as I loved the bed it was served over, my fish was so salty, I jokingly said maybe they forgot to wash the salty ocean water off of it. Trying to crack a joke as we were so unamused with our food. My mom had the pan seared scallops which were served over a bed of julienned kale and carrot puree. The scallops were large, delicately butter and meaty, but sadly, salty. Not sure who seasoned them, but they have a heavy hand for seasoning. Fortunately, the sweetness from the carrot puree minimally diminished the salt taste. We ordered a sweet alcoholic mixed drink in hopes of washing down the salt, but not even that couldn't take the unpleasant taste out of our mouths. 

Service: Friendly and personable server provided great customer service.

Price: About $25-$35 for most plates, usually I'd say this is reasonable, but considering the taste of our food... we felt completely ripped off.

Ambiance: The atmosphere during our dining experience made the experience a bit better, we were seated outside with a nice ocean view, I hold the calming sound of the ocean responsible for keeping us calm. 

Overall: Great ambiance and service. Unfortunately our food was overly salty, not just one dish, but all of our dishes. Maybe we had a bad experience, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that mildly cares about their health.",Astrid Z.,"Berkeley, CA",4.0 star rating

Price is steep but similar for other Hawaiian locations near by. Had wonderful cocktails, great salads which the split for us onto 2 plates to share and delicious fish.

I had tried calling in for takeout because I try not to dine in when places are getting close to closing because I worked in a restaurant for 7 years. I get it, you want to go home. However upon calling the hostess let me know that they don't do takeout after 6 pm. Weird but okay. We were not well received upon our arrival. The woman who seated us was very hasty and clearly agitated that were were there. They still had about 7 other tables dining in on the patio where we were so it's not like we were the last in the house. Throughout our very brief dining experience here (we just wanted to eat and get out of there because it was pretty uncomfortable) the woman who seated us ended up serving us as well and she was just as rude throughout the entire visit. I even acknowledged that they were closing soon, and offered to take my order to go and even that irritated her. Not sure what happened in her day for her to treat her tables this was but it was very unfortunate. The grilled cheese was delicious and the fries were salty. Yum.

One of the best meals I had the entire time in Hawaii!!!! The fish tacos were recommended by a handful of people before we came. Omg. To die for. I've had them 2 times already and hoping for one more before we head home. Delicious.  Super fresh tasting. Lots of toppings. Get em you won't be disappointed!

My plus one had a Korean chicken sandwich. He said the chicken was cooked well with lots of flavor and the coleslaw was really good. 

Their kids meals were great for my boys. Both boys ate it up.

8/20/2016,5.0 star rating,"Loved our evening at Leilani's.   We got there around 6:30 pm and there was a 20 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all as the restaurant is situated right along the beach so you can take a nice oceanside walk while you wait!   There is an option to sit in the patio or dine inside the restaurant.   Inside dining is a bit more upscale while outdoor dining is more casual, so we chose to sit outside for the view and so our kids would be more comfortable.    

Started with some white wine and my husband had a mai tai which he enjoyed.   The kids had some passionfruit juice that was also great, very sweet but of course they love that.    For our entrees, I had the ahi tuna bowl with taro chips and a side of white rice- it was so flavorful and the fish was fresh!   My husband had the fish of the day which I believe was opah or some sort of fresh white fish, which he really enjoyed, and then the kids had chicken strips from the kids menu.   All the food was great and our server was super attentive - which is always a plus especially when you have young kids.   For dessert we had to go for the Hula Pie- rich macadamia nut ice cream on a cookie crust and loaded with hot fudge- omg, this was unbelievable!!!    Left feeling stuffed and happy.

There was a small amount of kimchi on it too but it wasn't too spicy at all. Just delicious. The fries it came with were pretty bad but that's okay because the chicken sandwich itself was  huge.

My wife ordered the seafood pasta and I got the clam chowder off the appetizer menu and we shared. First, the seafood pasta was fantastic: delicious large shrimp, half a lobster tail, and big chunks of Hawaiian fish, sautéed without noticeable spices. The seafood pasta was more like a seafood sampler with a few noodles and strips of good tasting cheese. Second, rather than trying to hustle us into ordering two entrees, our waiter said the seafood pasta was a filling meal and a good meal to share.

10/2/2016,4.0 star rating,"I really like this place, one of the highlights. Food, drinks, to our server was amazing. 

Me, my boyfriend and another couple came here during the evening. Parking was not bad, we got a bit lucky. However we did come the day before and after 30 minutes of looking for parking we left. So I am glad we came back. 

It was a bit confusing at first and wish the ladies at the desk would have told us about the menu differences. We had to walk back and forth, inside to outside and then inside again. The restaurant offers two different menus so if you want to dine outside they offer more simple items such as sandwiches compare to dining inside for better/classy entres. We originally wanted to sit outside but decided to eat inside due to the menu differences. We still got a pretty nice table with an overlook of the beach. 

Our server was the best!!! He was super nice and answered all our questions about the different entres. He was able to go into details about the different fishes and their textures. (I'm not that great with fishes). The drinks were incredible, I ordered the lava flow drink and wish I ordered another. Pricing was a little on the higher end but it didn't comes as a surprise since we were in Maui.

We also ordered the Cajun Fries, which were pretty tasty, but the sauce that it came with had a lot of chunks of spices, as if it hadn't been mixed well enough.

The regular restaurant is on open table,make a reservation( inside tables only) - if you want to sit in the bar/ front walk, you'll need to go to Leilani's On The Beach. All tables are outside.  The Beach doesn't take reservations.  After 8:15- he crowd dies significantly.
We arrived at 8, waited abour 20 minutes, told 30 wait.  Score 1 bonus star.
Ordered Kaula Porl Spring rolls ($$12.50). So good. Score another bonus star.
My cheeseburger ($15.50) was flavorful, cooked exactly as I had asked, alothough it was so juicy the bottom bun was soggy and the white cheese was so melted that it was grainy. Didn't matter- one of the best burgers that I've had in long time.
My husband ordered the fish tacos($19.00)- they were devoured.
And then came the Hula Pie ($10.00). We should gone straight to dessert. As good as my cheeseburger was, the Hula Pie was delicious.

Ambiance:
Parking |  Parking seemed tight but we got pretty lucky especially parking right behind Leilani's. Room for about 20 cars.

Seating | We were more in the patio/bar area where there is group seating and bar seating as well all right in front of the ocean.

Feels | A wonderful place to be. You have this GORGEOUS beach in front of you and if you're there for the right day and time, live music of some good covers. If you're not into that then you get your typical sports on TV. Great place for family, older adults, or tourists.

Food:
Loco Moco Fries (Strongly Recommend)
I'm a fries guy.....I still dream about those fries. It did take a while but it was delicious. Fries were fried and pretty crispy and a subtle crunch. How this stood out was the loco moco sauce. That delicious umami flavor, you don't need anything else.

Customer Service:
Solid customer service. Respectful dude, I did wish the fries came faster buuuut...I can't complain really.

TL;DR (Overall)
4.5 stars. Reasonable price, DELICIOUS fries, and a wonderful ambiance. For tourists, I highly recommend this place. Good music, beautiful food, and palate pleasing food.

But please be aware that if you DO NOT order a full meal or happen to be younger than our server, who happened to be an older lady with glasses and likely in her 60s, you will not get any sort of service.  She catered to all four tables around us who happened to be closer to her age and who all ordered full meals.  We still ordered three rounds of cocktails and items off the happy hour menu and regular menu, but she couldn't be bothered to pay attention until she noticed we wouldn't just be ordering one item off the happy hour menu and coors light.

I will also recommend the pork spring roll starter as well as the ice cream pie desert - but one for four diners is more than enough - the portion is massive!
When it rains, make sure you sit closer to the bar - it leaks under the umbrellas and no matter how you reconfigure the table, it remains wet.

Came here after looking at Yelp reviews. The location is beautiful: right on the Kaanapali beach. However, the food is average at best. We tried to avoid tourist traps but I have to say that this seems to be one. The menu on paper looks amazing, but the execution is not. We ordered fish tacos (award winners, apparently) and the Kalua pork egg rolls. The fish tacos were definitely generic. The tortillas were nothing special. The fish was Cajun style, which I have a personal bias against because when done like this it seems to hide more than it compliments. It was also over cooked. Definitely forgettable.

The Kalua pork egg rolls were the low point. Sounded so good, but they were grease bombs. The flavors were off and we told the server that they were really disappointing. She was nice enough to take them off of the bill.

6/23/2016,5.0 star rating,"Came down for dinner and opted to make reservations at 8 for 3 people. We were in the area  since 7:30 and so we had a 30 minute wait. But don't let all my math fool you. With all the shopping in the area (at the Whaler's village) it's definitely easy to pass time. We spent a while in sephora's before making our way back to the restaurant on the other end of the complex. 

We were seated upstairs and had a nice view of the wonderful dark ocean lol. It was night time and we did not mind what view we had as long as we got fed!! Bula, our server, filled up our water glasses and helped us in making a decision. He also bought out some fresh baked sourdough bread to munch on. 

A friend and I ordered the maui onion filet which came with sides of green beans sprinkled with furikake, and mashed potatoes with a pile of bacon. My sister got the prime rib that had an AMAAAAAZING horseradish sauce. The food came out in a decent amount of time but my problem was that my filet, which was suppose to be medium, was a slab of well cooked leather instead lol :( since it was busy and smack dab in the middle of the dinner rush, it took about 10 minutes to get someone's attention. The manager, I believe, came over to our table and rectified the situation immediately and surely enough I got a filet that was cooked to medium. It was juicy, tender, and not to mention easier to cut lol.

With barely enough room for dessert, they bought out a hula pie that was to die for! Overall, we had a good time, and service was great! Would recommend to anyone in the area.

The fresh sourdough bread was hot and easy to fill up on if you weren't careful. Our waitress was attentive and very helpful. We didn't have to wait very long for our food after placing our orders. I had the fish of the day special which was Monchong fish. I love that fish and this preparation didn't disappoint. The other orders of chicken and steak were very good as well according to those in our party. 

For dessert we had to have a slice of their famous Hula Pie which was as good as ever. We also split a fruit tart with ice cream and caramel sauce. Both were great desserts. 

A couple of reasons why only a four star ranking was the lack of overall choices on the menu. For instance, the appetizers were pretty limited if you don't like seafood. I do but no one else in my party does and I didn't want to eat a whole appetizer myself. Another reason for the ranking is the portion size for the price was a little meager. I know this is a resort area and you expect to pay a little more than normal, it seemed like at least the fish special I ordered was smaller than it easily could have been.

We sat in the restaurant which is more for dining and the shrimp is served outside which is more casual but our server brought it up anyway. HOLY COW!! What have I been missing all my life!! Their coconut shrimp alone made my night! Sooo good! Also the server brought out a complimentary hula pie for my son's birthday...so freaking good!!

6/23/2017,5.0 star rating,"We really enjoyed our experience here with good food, good service, and a great view. We were seated on a side patio area where we had a great view of the ocean. Our server was friendly and prompt. For our appetizer, we ordered the chowder which was flavorful and yummy. We ordered the scallops, which were quite delicious and buttery. I do wish there were more mashed potatoes with the scallops. We also ordered the king crab legs, which came with quite a bit of meat. It would be better if the side of rice was more flavored than just being plain rice. The dish did not have much flavor (but that could be the point of having fresh crab legs). During our dinner it began drizzling a bit, and the servers promptly rolled out an overhead canopy to protect the open patio area from rain. Overall we very much enjoyed our experience and would definitely come back again for the great view, for the comfortable atmosphere, and to try some of the other entrees.",Marilyn L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating

1/2/2017,1.0 star rating,"My least favorite in ALL of Maui.
We dined here while on our honeymoon one night after sunset.
The wait was about an hour and when we sat down outside, the seating area was so dimly lit that we had a hard time reading the menu.
Service was immature and slow. The servers were a bunch of teenagers that were extremely careless.
We ordered appetizers and entrees and waited for over an hour for two burgers. 
The burger and fries were sloppy to be kind.
The fries were plain and soggy and the burger was squeezed next to the fries in a tiny plastic bowl.
Once I tried to lift the burger to eat it completely fell apart.
One because of how tightly packed it was in the bowl and two because it was very soggy.
After waiting an hour and paying an arm and a leg for a burger I really did not want to sit and construct it while the servers ran around chatting with each other. 
I tried to call ours over but she was MIA so I had to ask someone else. That of course took longer than needed and eventually had to contact the manager.
The so called manager came over and seemed extremely uninterested and was not helpful.
I pretty much had to demand for a fresh burger and my husband sat there waiting for my food to be ready, while his got cold.
They placed it on a plate and brought it out another half hour later.
The burger was absolutely nothing special.
I'm honestly a bit bummed that we wasted a meal here.
Will not return on our next visit.

I ordered a cheeseburger, added avocado; while my boyfriend ordered their legendary fish tacos.
both dishes were off the chain!! so deliciously prepared.

I was there on my own do was not attempting a conversation, but had to just point at the menu to order!  Seriously, my ears were ringing for awhile after I left.  

I had a Mai Tai and the fish tacos.  The Mai tai was quite good with a good balance of fruit and rum.  The fish tacos were tasty, with generous filets, and a nice, not overpowering slaw.  The chips and salsa accompanying the tacos were good.

The presentation was superb, the fish was cooked to perfection, and the dish had sweet, salty, and tart flavors which complemented but did not overwhelm the fish. Delicious cabbage, pea greens, diced pineapple, and edible flower petals made it a feast for the eyes as well as the palette. The prices were very reasonable considering the location.

We were excited that they had calimari strips on the menu, as most restaurants always have rings. So we ordered those for an appetizer, my wife got the fish tacos, and I ordered the Chefs fresh Hawaiian Catch of the Day, which was Moonfish, and I was excited to try it. The calimari never showed up, but our entrees did. Our server said there was a screw up, and took them off our check (seemed fair....since we never got them!) My wife's tacos were very good. My Moonfish never made it either, because they were out of it. So next up was broadbilled swordfish. The swordfish was very good.....but it was covered in pesto sauce. I'm not a big fan of pesto. Don't recall that being in the description of the fish anyway. All in all, it's a nice place, and I would try it again.

As locals from Oahu these are usually the kinda of places we don't really prefer to eat (aloha shirt and khaki uniforms, high chance of tourist trap) but what a great meal we had.  
**make reservations, we walked in early and got sat right away but as we left I overheard the hostess tell a party of 2 the wait was 45 min to an hour!
** if you're kama'aina 1 free dessert, whatever the icecream pie was and that thing was delish!! Can we say cookie crust... Oh yes we can.

Our server I think his name was Adam was very friendly and not pushy, never felt rushed even as a party of 6.  

FOOD: Apps... Poke and crab cakes and Maui onion soup.  The poke with slaw and taro chips, definite winner.  Next time nix the soup and crab cakes and do 3 orders of that poke :)

Entrees: seafood pasta, chicken, steaks.  Everything was cooked perfectly, including my juicy chicken! Loved all the vegetables I got, I'm a veggie lover so that was great.

Negative notes and there's only 2, service could've been a tad more attentive but it was crazy busy.  Took near forever for someone to help us when a beer was spilled even though numerous servers saw as they walked past us.  We ended up piling all our dirty napkins silverwear and plates in the corner which continued to sit there even after we asked for new settings.

Some of the best martinis on the islands this time around. Martinis in Hawaii seem weak and watered down here to me anyway. Maybe due to the tight ABC oversight in Hawaii.

Anyway, I had the Mahi Mahi special and cooked to my specification. White fish is easily dried out and over cooked if your not particular and ask it be medium rare. It will rest to perfect texture and moistness. It was by far, the best Mahi Mahi I've ever had! Excellent meal.

The Tuna was perfectly cooked with a shutake soy mushroom sauce and rice.  AMAZINg!

My husbands sirloin was delicious.  It cane with bacon mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. The veggies were a little hard. The sirloin a tad bit more blue vs med rare. It didn't stop him though!  He had a nearly clean plate.

6/28/2016,5.0 star rating,"Came to Leilani's Dining Room on a Monday night. Location is very touristy but the ambiance is fun; lots of music, very lively but you can still hear each other talk. Our service was wonderful, everyone was attentive and friendly. 

When we first opened the menu, the dessert options jumped out at me from the first page. What kind of crazy people put desserts on the menu before the main courses? The kind that make heaven on a plate in the form of hula pie, but I'll get to that later. 

Ordered the Parmesan crusted fish of the day (mongchong), sirloin steak, and filet mignon. No complaints about any of the food; everything was well cooked and seasoned but nothing was extraordinary. What caused me to give five stars instead of four were the drinks and dessert. Tried the Ginger Hoku and Lava Flow cocktails. Ginger Hoku was light and refreshing, just the right amount of sweet and the flavor combo was great. Lava Flow was like a perfectly made strawberry daiquiri, very sweet (it's like dessert WITH dinner).  I usually don't go for the dessert-like cocktails but I'm so glad I did at Leilani's. 

FINALLY it was time for dessert. Ordered the seasonal hula pie for three people, and we all thought it was fantastic. The usual hula pie has a Oreo crust but the seasonal had a chocolate macadamia nut crust. There were also pieces of butterfinger in the ice cream and on top of the pie, which is also different from the usual. The slice of pie was gigantic, I wouldn't recommend that anyone order a slice to themselves unless they want to bring type II diabetes and high blood pressure home as souvenirs. 

I would definitely return to Leilani's, and would try any of their other restaurants (Duke's, Kimo's, and others). If you go to one of their places and bring a receipt to any of the others (or return to the first) they'll give you a free dessert. Also, they validate Parking at the shopping center, though you can also park for free behind Leilani's in any spot marked ""beach access"".",Ilana V.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating

I had the flat iron steak.  It melted in my mouth.  My husband ordered the pork chop and the glaze was superb:  sweet, with the right amount of tang.  We ended our dinner with hula pie.  Not what our tummies needed, but we almost finished that, too.

Chris was our server and he was kind, fun and easy to laugh.  Jason, the manager stopped by the congratulate us.  That was super sweet and unexpected!  Both of them made us feel like old friends.

Seared ahi tuna- just amazing. Tuna was ruby red, slightly seared. Sauce was touched by God and made with magic. Jasmine rice was cooked perfectly and had a subtle sweat coconut flavor. Asparagus was char grilled and also cooked perfectly. This was my first meal on the island and it is a shame bc no meal has or probably will surpass this one in terms of technique, flavor or quality. Truly one of the best things I've ever eaten. Ever. I would fly 12 hours just to come back.

Boyfriend had the parmesan crusted fresh catch which was soooo good. Green beans that it came with were ever so lightly blanched. Sauce again was made with magic. So savory.

We sat beachside. The nice bar was right there, but there was also a group of hooligans that stood by the bar acting stupid & loud. I didn't know that it was that type of bar where ppl came in drunk & were allowed to act like they were at a club.  There were kids and families around.  Trust me, I'm not terribly uptight but there's a time & place for everything!

Note: the menus vary from indoor seating to beachside. Prices are higher indoors.  

Lorraine, our server, was great.   

Our apps, nachos and calamari, were ehhh.  Nothing special really.  Nachos needed pico de gallo or something to spruce it up.  Calamari was fat strips. Tender but salty. And the cocktail sauce was very spicy from the horseradish so kids may not appreciate it!

I had the Chef's Hawaiian Catch which was the monchong fish.   It was a bit overcooked & dry as a result but I did enjoy the crunchy kale under it.  

My husband had the Beachside Burger which was just okay.  He usually eats all the fries but didn't.  That's a good indicator he wasn't all pleased. 

My son had the fish & chips. For the kids order he chose fresh fruits. The amount of fruits was impressive. The highlight for him was the Tropical Smoothie.

The hostess worked her magic and got us seated about ten minutes after our reservation time. I spent some time observing her and she was hardworking, bright, and very pleasant even to all the demanding, impatient patrons such as myself ;)
My husband and I were seated in the dining area upstairs. It was romantic but so dark we had to shine the flashlight from our phones to see the menu. We laughed when we saw another couple do the same. I ordered a vodka lime soda pre-dinner. It was probably the best one I've had. My tuna sashimi was super fresh  and tasty.

Nothing on the island is really cheap, but here I felt the food was worth it. My husband ordered the filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked and paired with veggies.

My husband ordered the fish tacos and loved them. He even helped me finish my plate when I was full! The drinks were delicious. If you like POG and Mai tai then there is a drink for you here!

4/15/2017,2.0 star rating,"We were staying at the Hyatt Regency and looking to head out to dinner at nearby beach front restaurants...after doing some researching, two places caught my eyes. Both popular beach front restaurants at Whalers village close by ( beautiful outdoor mall with high end stores ) 
Hula Grill and Leilani's. 
Hula Grill had our party of 6 wait at least 45 mins so we went with Leilani's which quoted us 15 min wait. My husband and my boys don't like to wait too long to eat. 
Our name was called within 20 mins. We were lead past open kitchen to an small dark outdoor area under the deck...it was stuffy and consisted of 4 tightly fitted tables. My husband and I use to wait tables back in our college years so we both laughed and said it must be the worst section in the house. We backed to a small wall decorated with an outdated painting. Faced another small wall with another outdated painting, and If we push away the flower bed of unkempt plants masking the unused potion of the undedeck space we could have had a peek of the ocean :(
Well, we were at least seated so we didn't argue. 
Our sever was very enthusiastic, he brought us warm Hawaiian rolls with sweet whipped butter to start with. It was tasty but it's the same Hawaiian rolls you can buy yourself to the grocer store. The server mentioned they use to bake sourdough rolls but they changed it because it too too long to bake. 
For rest of our meal unfortunately my boys weren't super duper hungry so we didn't get to try a lot of appetizers but just a few main entrees. My husband got the Mahi Parmesan crusted with lemon caper reduction which came with green beans ( vegetable of the night ) The fish was small and not very moist, but the reduction was tasted good. My eldest son got the Sesame crusted Ahi steak. Tuna MR arrived on a bed of jasmine rice and garnished with few grilled asparagus spears. The server really pushed this entree. We are avid tuna\sashimi eaters. Sadly, we didn't think it was up to par. The tuna had too many white marbling which makes it hard to cut and chewy to eat. The shiitake soy butter was tasty though. 
My middle sons shared a dish of sirloin steak in red wine reduction with sautéed Maui onions, bacon mashed potatoes,. They are huge steak lovers and they said it was fine, nothing spectacular. 
My youngest son had kid mac and cheese which came with green beans. He didn't like the mac and cheese at all. Not because it was Not the Kraft box version but this white sauced version was runny and flavorless. He took only two bites and was done. 
I got the Pan SearedCatch of the nigh which was Ono. I love Ono and the description sounded perfect to me. Sautéed Kula corn, local greens which that night was leeks, green beans, bok choy?, edamame with tomato vinaigrette. Menu said it included Molokai sweet potato gnocchi and Chinese sausage but there were only 3 tiny pieces of sausage and 3 small purple gnocchis. I had to search for those. LOL. Overall my dinner was tasty mostly because the combinations of the vegetables and seasoning was delicious. The fish itself was just ok. But as my husband says. We are paying for the fish not the veggies though.....
We didn't get any desserts as we just want to get back to the hotel after a long day outside. Had the ambience been nicer and food better, we would of hung out longer. 
Btw. I did say mention that I mentioned to our server about our disappointment with our view at the beginning of our meal. He said they will be starting renovation in May but didn't offer an apology nor offer us any compensation for our disappointment ( not that we wanted anything in return but the principal would have been nice )

In conclusion, I was reading all these rave reviews about this place and I can't say I agree. We've traveled so many places with fantastic foods and great views and this restaurant was non of those for us.",SD M.,"Ashburn, VA",4.0 star rating

5/22/2015,4.0 star rating,"Had a reservation and got seated right away. Service was knowledgeable and friendly. Honestly everywhere I went in Hawaii the service was very friendly and attentive (which could be hit or miss back in NY)

I ordered the Parmesan crusted fish of the day. I'm pretty sure it was called Monchong. It was a flakey white fresh that was light and sweet. I'm going to see if I can find this fish out by me because it was delicious. If you like cod and Mahi Mahi you would like this fish. The dish was delicious start to finish. Fish was perfectly seasoned and crispy. Sautéed veggies al dente, good mashed potatoes (pretty lumpy in some parts) pops of brineyness from the capers. Lemon butter sauce was scrape your plate clean kinda good.

Someone in my party ordered their filet mignon well done (yikes! I know) and it came out cooked medium it was pink inside. Our waiter offered more than once to take it back and the manager came over to see if they wanted a new filet to be cooked ""because they wanted everything to be perfect"" they decided to just keep it and eat it they way it was prepared. ( this was a blessing, well done beef is a sin in the food world in my opinion) So again service was on point and always wanted us to leave happy.

We got two hula pies to split between the 5 of us a regular one and a cappuccino chip one. If you like coffee ice cream I would suggest getting the cappuccino one. I actually preferred the original it was like an ultimate ice cream sundae. Vanilla ice cream was just soft enough to cut through, hot fudge sprinkled with macadamia nuts served on top of an Oreo crust with a spritz of whipped cream. Yum yum. 

Most entrees were under $35. If you get seated outside you can have a great view of the sunset but if Mosquitos like you, like they like me you will get eaten alive.",Genevieve R.,"Long Island, NY",4.0 star rating

Five star experiences both visits then and of course the standout is their Mahi-mahi fish tacos. Goodness gracious I could go everyday to have those tacos while in Maui. Our most recent trip to Leilani's was in May 2017.  The service was excellent along with the fantastic ocean view from the patio. We ordered the flat iron steak and the fish tacos! Well the tacos again where out of this world good. It's hard to match that memory of a standout meal,but Leilani you did. What surprised me was how delicious the flat iron steak was. I found myself torn as to what I may order when I dine here again. I found their prices reasonable in the resort atmosphere, with a much higher quality of food.

8/3/2016,5.0 star rating,"Tried my first hula pie, it's yum! It's a large ice cream cake slice with a oreo like crust, chocolate fudge and lots of whipped cream. Share this with the table, it's not made for one.

That aside, I didn't realize that making reservations would result in dining inside. (Not that I really care.) The dining room and downstairs have different menu items and ambiance, indoors seemed a bit more fancy and we weren't dressed. 

Anyways our server Bula was awesome,  he recommended a bunch of items for us since it was our first time. I ordered the Paniolo prime rib based on his suggestion,  it was served with a horseradish sauce, there was a side of furikake green beans and mash potatoes.  I don't like green beans in general and couldn't taste the furikake but again don't care for that.

The veggie burger was okay; it's the same veggie pattie used at all the places on the island but the buck wheat bun was pretty bad. We were staying at the Westin and had missed breakfast one day so we needed a place to eat at. We had seen this place all week and it generates a pretty big crowd.

The seafood pasta had a variety of seafood (fish, calamari, shrimp, etc) but it was mostly fish. We loved the noodle that they used (a short, twisty noodle) and the lemony cream sauce was out of this world. 

The farmers salad was delicious and tasted very local and organic, and the goat cheese was a good addition. The grilled shrimp were buttery and tasty - just a bit expensive for the quantity you get!",Amy Y.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

We also had a goat cheese plate with three types of local cheese. Macadamia crusted variety was stellar. Pesto flavored one also good. There was also a mustard kimchee flavor that was interesting but crazy spicy. 

Cocktails were good but a but sweet for my taste. 

Service was quick and friendly, too. Seated in a nice windowed area with great breezes. 

Giving 4 stars rather than 5 because I think this place is too pricey. While good, $26 for a chicken breast and $17 for a plate of goat cheese feels a bit outrageous... Even for the resort area of the island. Still great, though!",Steve S.,"San Jose, CA",4.0 star rating

I have no idea, after I went back to the hotel stunned of what just happened pat of me told me not to eat the salad but I went against my feelings and I should have listened to my gut feeling, right after I ate the some of the salad I started having the worst stomach ache , I honestly think he did something to my salad or put something in it .

I hardly think it wouldn't break the bank to add a handful of french fries to a child's plate, especially when you call it Fish and Chips and charge $9.

I didn't expect great food, but being from SF, sitting outside in a dress was already making me happy. This place is huge, and it has a lot of indoor tables, so if you want to sit outside you need to request it. 

What we remember most from here was our waiter, he was so high, he couldn't get the order straight, came back to take it twice, and couldn't even repeat it back to us.  By some miracle the food arrived and was right.

The scallops were overcooked, the fish also dry unfortunately, that was a shame, my husband cooks way better scallops than this, and places that cook fish all day long should be drying it out, but fine, we had low expectations going in, so we weren't too shocked.",Inga W.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

Upstairs; service was immaculate, the food was astonishingly good, (we did the chef's tasting menu), the view was extraordinary; it was all things a fine dining experience should be.  

Downstairs is loud, filled with raucous drunk tourists, service was spotty, food was greasy and sort of awful.  I was not at all pleased with our experience for downstairs, especially after waiting for 45 minutes, and not realizing that what we were waiting for was the bar, and not the restaurant.

I had the sweetest server named Kendall. I told her that I was allergic and she told me to pick two things that I wanted to eat and she would check. Not only did she check with the chef. She actually started pulling down stuff like mayo to make sure I wouldn't get a reaction. I have never had anyone do that for me.

To make it better, the manager came over to our table to tell us this. And to make sure we were having a good experience. Where else can I get service like this? 

Now onto the food. The food was amazing. The drinks were super fun and fruity. And I had their breadfruit pie. Yes it was the first time I had breadfruit. Yes it is amazing. Yes you need to try it!

This place is a little pricey. But with the service I got I would be glad to pay that money.

MY FIRST 100 STAR REVIEW!!!!",Kate T.,"Aiea, HI",4.0 star rating
3/19/2017,3.0 star rating,"This is an extremely convenient upscale restaurant near the Westin and Hyatt Regency Maui.  Generally the food prices are high and comparable to other decent or nice restaurants in the area however they have a prefix or set menu every day from 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. seating which allows you to get pre fixe 3 course meal for $26 per person.  We ate there two separate times and both times the fish was overcooked. The service was above average but not great.  You should make a Reservation to get good seats, and not wait for a long time. Food quality above average.  I would rate this place a true 3.5 out of 5 stars. b",Adnan I.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
1/7/2016,4.0 star rating,"First dinner in Maui and it definitely set the bar high. Firstly, this restaurant should be $$$ not $$. Entrees start around $30, unless you get the chef tasting menu for $26 (between 5-5:45pm only). The chef tasting menu comes with appetizer, entree and dessert. Now the portion is suppose to be smaller than normal entree but it's really not much smaller. So if you are not ravenous, this is definitely a good choice. Crab cakes were one of the best I've had. Didn't care much for the pork egg rolls that came as appetizer with the chef menu. So all of our entree were pretty delicious, fresh fish, good flavor. I didn't care much for the monchong, it was pretty bland. The parm crusted mahi was the best ordered dish on our table. For dessert we had the hula which is pretty big. Service was just excellent!!! Our waiter knew the menu and the dishes inside and out. Very impressed!",Sarina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0 star rating

Prices are standard for the view.  We arrived just before 6 and were seated in 10 minutes at a nice table with a view.  I appreciate that they did not pass us up for a group of 4 as the table would seat 4.  The place was buzzing and service was great.

I visited with friends who are visiting from the mainland with their two kids. The servers were great with the kids. They had special kids plates for the kids menu. 

I had the a'u sandwich. The sandwich was great. The fish was cooked well. The sandwich toppings were local lettuce, tomato, and sprouts.  It came with jicama pineapple salad which was better than I anticipated (I'm not a huge fan of jicama).

They offered to validate our parking right away which was really nice, 3 hours free in the complex parking garage. I had the fish tacos, they were delicious. You get two tacos with good size pieces of fish and homemade chips with salsa. The sauce on them was a little spicy for my taste but overall, delicious. My husband had the Cuban sandwich and enjoyed that. My mother got the calamari and really enjoyed it. We also got the kahlua pork tacos as an appetizer, they were alright but did not have a lot of flavor. Overall i would recommend this restaurant!

Not good as this was major foot traffic area for everyone. I asked to be seated near front area, as there were 2 open tables sitting there empty. I was denied and told they were going to have guests. Ok, but they were sitting empty for 15 minutes. Our waiter Jonathan was great. We ordered dinner. I had opa which ended up being very dry.

How do you wait to have another waiter tell you that your customers are thirsty?! Took the order, gave us our ice water and iced tea then left us.  She disappeared!  To put it mildly...WTH?!?!

Our meal came to $66 and I gave $100 cash then she actually had the audacity to ask me if I want change?!  Are you kidding me?!  I am NOT paying you $36 dollars for tips!!  That's like 50% and with her service, she doesn't deserve it.

The Cesar salad was below standard as they used green leave lettuce instead of Romain lettuce.  The grilled chicken still had some pink in them.  Yes, under cooked.

11/28/2016,2.0 star rating,"[november 18th] 
This has been my go to spot for my birthday for a few years now. Never had a bad experience until this year. ( last few times was with Aaron. Best service I've ever had anywhere. Hope he's still there!) 
Keep in mind all four of us are servers on island in tourist based restaurants, and I had my daughter with us as well. I know that the tables upfront are 2 and 4 tops, but my daughter never sits in her own seat and we requested up there (my boyfriend called two weeks ahead of time) 
We got put right next to the kitchen, and the top of the stairs. The other half wanted to move but I didn't to be a pain in the ass. (They weren't busy, our reservation there was at 5:15, we got there early and they sat us at 5:20.) The server.. and again I don't like to complain, because I know everyone has their off nights, but she was horrible. So bad we didn't even bother getting her name because we knew we wouldn't use it through the night. We didn't take it personally until she went to the table next to us and was actually really friendly and talkative. Then we knew she was literally treating us like shit because we were kids. about 15 minutes in she took our drink orders, (Lilikoi mojitos- highly recommended) and came back fifteen minutes later to ID us when she brought my friends ice tea. (either id when someone order or at least ask if they're over 21, much more professional) took us about another 10-15 minutes to get our drinks.  Including my daughters drink. (Server saw my daughter was upset, and my daughter didn't even have her own water. we were sharing ours with her) 
Upstairs wasn't quite busy yet but I can't speak for downstairs. I always get the seafood pasta, always love it. Just a recommendation, tone down the lemon juice.. Way too overpowering, all we could taste. Love the sourdough bread though. The ahi dish was really good, really small though, not sure what the price was but I felt guilty even sampling a piece of it..  
We were planing on ordering Pono pie desert (our really good friends dad makes them and they're as ono tasting as they sound!) she brought us their house mud pie, and I know that's tradition because it was a ""special occasion"". It was good, personally I prefer without nuts on top (what about people with nut allergies? Just an idea...) but of course we ate it. she never came back to check on us so we never got to order the Pono pie. Our waters stayed empty from about halfway through dinner throughout the desert. She actually dropped the check without offering more water. I had to ask for more water for all four of our glasses. 

Summary here is, 
ask if Aaron still works there. Best service you could ever imagine. 
Lilikoi mojitos are to die for. 
Pono pie dessert is how you want to end your meal 
I've had some bad service, but this was one of my worst experiences. I gave two stars because I know the restaurant itself is very good.. or was? 
If you're a party of two request the railing. 
Five or more people you're screwed for seeing sunset due to the layout of the restaurant. 

I can't say I'll come back. I've been recommending this place to so many of my own guests for years and now I'm so disappointed by how our experience was and how we were treated.. it's a shame.",Brittney M.,"Kihei, HI",4.0 star rating
11/20/2016,2.0 star rating,"This is my first Yelp review, because I haven't had such a disappointing meal that was so expensive. Maybe our dishes were just ""off"" from the usual plating, etc. but there were multiple mishaps in our dishes. I ordered the ono dish - it was very overcooked, the green beans and onions were crunchy, and there was little to no sauce on my plate (from what I tasted was the best part). The components all together also just seemed strange. Bits of the ends of Chinese sausage were plated..all in all, I was confused and underwhelmed. My husband's steak was over cooked, and veggies were also crunchy. We had reasonable hopes for this restaurant, being on Kaanapali beach and had such good experiences prior.

WOMEN, YOU MUST ORDER THE ""ANUENUE"" COCKTAIL!!! It looks like a sunset but tastes like a rainbow!!! It's the most delicious frozen drink that has ever touched my lips. I could have sworn they forgot to put alcohol in mine (because I couldn't taste it) and downed it in a matter of minutes. The next thing I knew I was giggling up a storm and thought everything was the funniest thing I had ever heard. I guess there was alcohol in it after all.

The Hummus Trio takes the cake though. There are 3 types: Macadamia Nut, Classic & Pea/Bean (I'm not sure about last one, it's the green one in photo). Me and my wife were very very impressed with the Hummus dish. We will definitely go there one more time before flying back home.

10/7/2014,3.0 star rating,"I so hate to do this but in order for my review to still be relevant now, I have to update it.  I have been a regular of Leilani's forever as if you look at my review from 6 years ago, I mentioned that Leilani's was already our go to spot for our anniversary dinner for years in addition to other dinners during our stays and about 7 Hula Pie runs each year.  

They use to have such great value either with their early bird entrees or their happy hour slider specials, both of which are now gone.  I can understand that due to its great location that they have enough customers without offering the early birds or happy hour specials.  However, one of my pet peeves is when the price goes up and the quality and service goes down.  

I came here for my first meal this year straight from the airport.  When my drink came out, they apologized that it overflowed since it was so full but yet did not give me a napkin to clean up the mess left on the table, not even one to place under the drink.  As it ran across the table and started dripping on the floor by my leg making the birds come running over, it took over 5 minutes to flag someone else down to ask for a napkin to clean it up myself.  One of the fish dishes was just grilled but was lacking in overall flavor.

10/3/2015,4.0 star rating,"To be straight forward and honest as I begin this review, I was not looking forward to dinner when my mother informed me that we would be going to Leilani's for our final dinner in Maui. All I could think of was Dukes, Kimos, huge kitchens, all tourists, mediocre food. As a big foodie and glorified fat kid, I'm picky about what I'm going to eat, especially if I'm going to treat myself and eat non healthy dishes. I have to admit I really pre judged and was really wrong. We ended up having a truly wonderful meal and time at Leilani's. 

Our waitress was so kind and friendly! We began with bread and drinks. I found a bottle of Chardonnay I loved but being the only white wine drinker at the table I had no one to share it with. Then, I found out certain bottles you could order the HALF BOTTLES of! Win! I enjoyed a nice half bottle of La Crema Chardonnay to myself. 

For appetizers we shared the Crab Cake, Ahi Poke and Diver Scallops. The Poke was wonderful. The Scallops were great and cooked perfectly although I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce they came in. The Crab Cake had a little too much mayo for my taste but my moms boyfriend really enjoyed them.

Our entrees were the Filet and the Ahi Steak. I ordered my Ahi Steak with the sauce on the side and they Ahi was so thick and delecious I ended up just putting a little soy sauce on it instead and it was fantastic! I also ordered double asparagus rather than getting jasmine rice and veggies. There was no problem substituting which was nice. My boyfriend's Filet was cooked Medium rare just as we ordered it and the seasoning on the outside was so tasty. 

Of course we had a Hula Pie which I was NOT going to partake in because I know it's everywhere in Maui and just didn't seem worth it. However once it arrived at the table the hot fudge and Mac nuts just starred back at me and screamed ALEXA. So I had one bite, then two, and before I knew it I had helped my mom finish the entire thing.

3/14/2017,4.0 star rating,"My husband and I really enjoyed our meals here. So much so, we went to the beachside restaurant two nights in a row. He really liked the fish tacos and we both enjoyed the fresh catch of the day - which was ahi tuna both nights.

The poke bowl with taro chips was amazing and worth the trip for that alone. I also really enjoyed the hula pie!

This place loses 1 star because the mixed drinks are very weak and the wine portions are small, so stick to beer. The Hanalei IPA has a really nice subtle tropical fruit flavor that was surprisingly good.

The sweet rolls- yummy!
The ""fast"" service( this is debatable I'll explain more). 
The food good! The location unbelievable!!
Cons: steak was red and cold inside. Too rare and Cold. Sent it back then came back beautiful.
Waitstaff always in such a hurry!
The salads came out way too fast/ 
Ordered and two minutes later Salad!
Hmmm pre made? Felt the waiters were in such a hurry and didn't listen add didn't take the time to make it an enjoyable experience; rather the ""get them in and out feeling"".
I gave the waiter two credit cards and before I could tell him how to split it up and he whisked away so fast -I even went after him to find him to no avail and he split it down the middle without asking. Not our plan.
The wedge salad ordinary and the goat cheese and beer salad sub par Better at Cheesecake Factory.

2/25/2016,4.0 star rating,"This review is for Leilani's Beachside Grill.

First of all, I am not a huge fan of eating at overpriced resort restaurants. During my stay on Ka'anapali Beach, I ate almost all my meals in Lahaina. That being said, I think Leilani's Beachside Grill is one of your best options on Ka'anapali Beach. It rescued my family from heading out for food when it was late and we were exhausted.

The location is excellent (on the beach), the atmosphere is great, the Grill is slightly more affordable, and the food offerings are good, better than what my resort down the beach had to offer. I was also grateful for the Keiki (kids') menu.

The Ahi Poke Bowl ($18) was excellent and the Taro Chips were a great accompaniment.
The Siracha Guava Chicken Wings ($14.50) were tasty, though they could have been crispier, but the portion was actually bigger than I expected (about 10 wings). Some photos showed 5 wings.
Fish and Chips ($19.50) were well cooked, crispy, not greasy, and pineapple jicama salad was great.
Keiki Fish and Chips ($8.95). Yay for not having to pay for a full-price meal for my younger kiddo.

Prices were steep, but at least the food was good. Also, I appreciate that they have gluten-free options and they are labelled!",Grace K.,"Fort Collins, CO",4.0 star rating

Made reservations around time for sunset to ensure we wouldn't be disappointed but was greeted by our server Anthony. He was so aloof and brash that it immediately put a very negative feel on what should have been an amazing evening. It didn't really get solidified until after we ordered and he left the table and as soon as we saw him we asked if we could have a wedge salad as well. He then instructed us (yes, not a mistake on the word choice) that he had already put in our meal order, as if to say are you sure that will inconvenience me. Never have I had a server question an up sell as he did. I couldn't help but snap back and say ""can you please put in the salad order"".... He was this way all evening and despite the beautiful location and the sunset he really did put a damper on what has been an amazing anniversary vacation.

Decent with a tasty coconut curry dipping sauce (the highlight of the entire meal). I ordered the poke app (meh), and husband had the Cuban sandwich l, which he said was ok. Kiddo had their shells & cheese (not shells, just regular macaroni pasta-- not a huge deal), which was probable the best thing we ate. I ordered a local dark lager which I thoroughly enjoyed.

We had opa special and prime rib. Fish was nicely flavored with a good sauce (but just a tad over cooked, but how most people eat it from what I noticed). The gnocchi was actually pan fried and crispy, which was a nice texture change from the veggies. The prime rib was actually better than I expected - not sure if it's local beef which is fed differently? It was somehow sweeter and just tasty.

While I expected the sauces and sides to be uninspired I expected a long standing Hawaiian fish house to know how to cook fish.

Overall I was unimpressed. The place was very touristy (which I get, it's one of a handful of places available within walking distance of a few hotels). However, the food reminded me of basic fried beach food. I ordered the ginger hoku cocktail which was refreshing but barely had any alcohol. I ordered the Kalua pork Cuban sandwich and my husband the Korean fried chicken sandwich. Both were ok for beach side food but a bit overpriced for the quality. The pork sandwich had a good flavor, the chicken sandwich was ok- too overwhelmingly ""fried"".  The fries were ok, though I enjoyed the house salad with the sweet house salad dressing (I think it was strawberry or papaya seed dressing?).

The view is spectacular!

You must try their fish tacos, they are out of this world delicious. 

Save room for dessert you need to eat a Hula Pie.

(You can get a Hula Pie to-go If you are staying at a nearby hotel for a late night dessert)

2/6/2016,4.0 star rating,"Enjoying a few days in Maui, and staying on the west side in Napili.  Was heading to a show in Lahaina, and wanted a place close by, or on the way.  Checked reviews, and headed into Leilanis.  First off, it is located in  Kaanapali, in the Whalers Village.  Easy access, and plenty of parking in the multi level lot  (Leilani's will validate).

There are options in seating, with an lower level bar, with live music, or in the upstairs dining room.  We opted upstairs, and were very happy with a beach view seat.  I will also add a very nice and attentive staff.  

We arrived at 5:00 sharp, and chose a price fix special to attempt to sample as many different  items as possible, and it was all amazing, and so fresh.  The shrimp appetizer, to the Ono entree, to our varied desserts.....everything was great.  

I would definitely be back!",Tom P.,"Keller, TX",4.0 star rating
12/18/2016,3.0 star rating,"We are here twice on our trip, super good food, and fast amazing service the first visit, kind of a slow lazy guy the second time it took forever just for him to greet us.  I will say though, that both the fish and chips and the fish tacos seem slightly overpriced for the amount of food and size of pieces of fish you get, I'm not saying I want a huge helping but I feel as though my fish should be at least the length of the taco shell because the last couple bites were all cabbage and tortilla.  And the fish and chips at the table next to us got 3 decent sized pieces and I got 2 rather small chunks/squares.  All and all great flavors, super fresh and semi decent service.",Gray F.,"Chico, CA",4.0 star rating

Our waiter was a very friendly and knowledgable young man.  The ocean/sunset view was amazing.  Service was very good.  People seemed to be really enjoying themselves (as were we) - the mood was happy and festive.  
The food was very good.

5/20/2016,3.0 star rating,"We stopped by Leilani's twice since it was right next to our hotel.  The first time, we went for dinner.  The wait was about 25 minutes.  We all ordered the fish and chips which turned out to be really dry with small portions of fish for the price (about $20).  The fries and the side jicama salad that came with the fish were great.  We received our food really quickly after we ordered which was great.  It was also really noisy during dinner time which made it difficult for my fiance's father to hear with this hearing aids.

The second time we visited, we just came for happy hour.  They had standard happy hour pricing/drinks (about $5/beer, $6/cocktail).  We sat at the bar and let the bartender know that we were only there for drinks since we just had lunch.  He was fine with that, but a different bartender kept pushing us to order food for some reason which was just kind of annoying.  Overall, we would probably skip Leilani's next time.",Annalyse M.,"Colorado Springs, CO",4.0 star rating

Got there at 6:50 and they sat us right away upstairs. Breathtaking view at sunset. We both opted for the red sangria, it was so good! For dinner, I ordered the filet mignon and he ordered the Mahi (blackened) although it's original option was Parmesan crusted. Amazing! He said it was the best fish he has ever eaten (I don't like fish otherwise I would've tried) and my steak was the easiest thing to slice and so good!!

4/25/2017,4.0 star rating,"We were vacationing during spring break two weeks ago and were staying at the WESTIN MAUI next door. Decided to walk over and give it a shot and sooo glad we did. The appetizers were delicious and the Hula Pie was yummy! Originally I had made a reservation for dinner over the weekend on the upstairs dining area which is a little more formal. Unfortunately our plans changed and I canceled the reservation thru Open Table. Fast forward to the weekday and decided to just walk up right before HH to the outside area and we lucked out as it was not super busy and they put is in a great area and better yet we had the best server Kayleigh! Since we were a few minutes shy of when happy hour starts at 3p she waited to put our order thru at exactly 3p so that we could get the HH pricing. We ordered 3 pupus...Calamari strips, ahi poke bowl and coconut shrimp. If you are not super hungry and just want apps...you cannot go wrong with any of the 3 mentioned, delicious. The calamari has a delicious ponzu cocktail sauce that was unlike anything I have had with calamari, the ahi poke bowl tasted fresh and the avocado/onions were perfectly seasoned and paired with fresh tasting taro chips and finally the coconut shrimp had an amazing curried coconut dipping sauce that was to die for! Finally the Hula Pie is sooo good....that macadamia nut ice cream is addictive.

It was a great place to see the sunset! The waitstaff was super attentive, and very accommodating. The seafood pasta was the best item I tried, with real fresh pasta, a really nice light cream sauce, and a large portion of lobster and shrimp. Killed me to not be able to finish the giant portion it came in. Also tried the parmesan-crusted catch of the day, it was decent, but I probably should have opted for the pan-seared instead. Just came a little damp.

7/7/2015,5.0 star rating,"Fantastic restaurant in Whalers Village. If you're a tourist, this is a must go. 

First off, this restaurant get pretty crowded during peak dinner hours through the week so plan on making a reservation for larger parties in advance. The outdoor grill is only first come first serve but definitely worth the effort as the floor is cover with sand, allowing you to take off your shoes and feel like you're on the beach. 

Now, on to the food. I had a course of Sesame Crusted Ahi Steak which came with a side of coconut butter seasoned jasmine rice and grilled Kula asparagus. The Ahi was so fresh, it would just melt in my mouth and the sesame gave a slight flavor that complemented will. I give it a 10/10. 

The server was more than happy to recommend wine pairings and don't forget the desert. We followed it up with a Macadamia Nut Hula Pie, ice cream pie, which was to die for. Words cannot describe and requires a try from every patron.

*Pork Cuban- Kalua pork with pepper jack cheese, pickles, tomato, and a special sauce on a roll. It was awesome! Comes with a side of fries. The Kalua pork wasn't overbearing with liquid smoke like most people do. Real hawaiian Kalua style pig.

4/12/2015,5.0 star rating,"By far the best restaurant experience yet on Maui. You can either dine in the actual restaurant or eat at the beachside grill. If you want to dine in, you need a reservation. If you do beachside, it's walk in only and when I called she said the sweet spot is between 5 and 5:30 when happy hour is ending. We took her advice and arrived at 5:15 and only waited 10-15 minutes. Not long after, the wait was incredibly long. The location is absolutely gorgeous and the view from the patio is perfect. We started with the sashimi and the chilled Thai shrimp appetizer and both were wonderful. This place is rated (for at least the last couple years) as the best fish tacos on Maui so we had to try them and it didn't disappoint.

Our waiter, Maggie did an awesome job recommending drinks to us. We were very picky(no rum and no coconut) and she immediately recommended the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a and the Anuenue and both were so delicious! The Humuhumunukunukuapua'a was similar in taste to a Moscow Mule with Strawberry and the Anuenue was a pineapple concoction that was the best pineapple drink I've ever had!  Two thumbs up for their drinks! The bartender is doing an awesome job!

We also had the Bankok Beef Buckwheat Noodle Salad and the Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak. The Bankok beef was delicious but the noodles were lacking a little flavor, but then again it's a salad! The steak was perfectly charred to a perfect medium rare and instead of the rice, we had a substitute of their fat French fries(so good!). The macaroni salad is a pretty good one because of the extra addition of cucumber pieces.

Oh, you can't forget the beer battered onion rings! Those were nice and crispy and came with a side of mustard dip!  They also tell you to keep your receipt for a free dessert upstairs which has a different menu and is a bit fancier!

 We made reservations earlier in the day and were able to score a 6:45 reservation.  My wife let the hostess know ahead of time that we were on our honeymoon,  and we asked for a window seat (actually there are no windows) with an ocean view.  
We arrived and were very happy with our ocean view table.  We were able to enjoy the beautiful sunset as the restaurant is only a few feet from the beach. 
The night was a 5 star experience all the way around. The service was excellent throughout.  Our waiter Chad was very knowledgeable about the wines, as well as the menu. He was very personable and attentive.

6/10/2016,1.0 star rating,"Lunch.

The $35 half bottle of Duckhorn Savignon Blanc was excellent.

The rest at $70 for two dishes and one salad was mostly greasy slop that had been stored on a heater in the back for hours to be plopped onto a plate.  Oh, okay, the 4 ounces of white swordfish planted on top of the mess of wheat noodles was broiled to a light toasty color... too bad it was so thin that it came out over cooked - you know, really hard all the way through.  Granted, it was a premium piece of swordfish that was quite fresh from the sea.

OK, OK, the salad lettuce was not limp, and the walnuts not rancid, and strawberries were sweet.

Dropped in for lunch on June 9, 2016. The main grand entrance was completely unstaffed so we wandered around and discovered activity downstairs in at the beach bar. From there we had to walk through the bar about 100 feet to the host station who informed us that full menu was back upstairs now two floors up.  OK, I guess this is not peak season and this place is huge, but really, do Hawaiians have signs to give directions to the stupid tourists with the money on their pockets?

Nice view of ocean--check. Stupid inane thumpy thumpy musak junk sounds we hear in seemingly every programmed ""experience"" commercial space these days.

Yet another server who speaks so quickly one can not understand blathering on and on about all the ingredients and processing except somehow the cup of monosodium glutamate in each serving just happened to be off the list.

Or was that just the can of liquid smoke poured over the mess that was supposed to be part of the ""smoked ham"".  Utah has more salt that this chef put in the plate.

Oh, yeah, they have FISH TACOS!  Isn't that just delightful?  Maybe they have cheesecake! Psst...Just ask the waiter for what is ""not on the menu"".  Travel 3,000 across the ocean to a tropical Hawaiian paradise and you too can have a fish taco within 1,000 feet of the Louis Vuitton shop.  Who'da thunk it?

I ate the fish and left all but two bites of the slop on the plate.  I had just been clobbered by a tourist trap that serves Duckhorn S

We had calamari strings which is ok as appetizer then both had fish tacos. I liked the tacos a lot because first you can't get fish taco at every taco places and second this is really good fish taco! It is spicy by itself (if you don't like spicy, sorry, not your cup of tea), with the spicy sauce , love it! The salsa is fresh and light. Awesome for chips!

Easy walk from any of the resort on this beach. Beautiful oceans view as all the other bars and restaurants on this road. 

If I must say something negative, 1, there are flies. Maybe need a bit pest control; 2, when they close the canvas, the table under it.....well I hope your food and drinks are covered!!!!! I feel ""stuff"" drop on my head maybe bird poop?",Jane H.,"PENRYN, CA",4.0 star rating

1/27/2016,4.0 star rating,"This is a great stop if you are staying or traveling to the Lahaina area. We stayed in keihi & drove up to Lahaina for the day. Leilani's has great outdoor seating. This was our first dinner out during our stay in Hawaii so I was a little surprised by the prices. But we soon figured out this was pretty common at other places too. 

We both had Mai Tai's, they were good. Not the best we had during our stay, but good. My husband had the fish tacos and I had the chicken entree. My husband said the fish tacos were some of the best he has ever had & the chicken entree was awesome as well! The Hawaiian style macaroni salad was tasty. But what needs to be talked about the most is the Hula Pie. My husband and I are from the Midwest and desserts are our thing. A meal doesn't feel complete without it. The hula pie was amazing. We both said we wished we would've skipped dinner and ate the hula pie twice. Make sure to order desert here!

Tip- keep your receipt and if you bring to Leilani's or any of it affiliate restaurants, with the purchase of two entrees you can receive a free hula pie.",Paige N.,"Kihei, HI",4.0 star rating

Even though it was supper crowed I did not feel rushed or neglected.  Our server was awesome she was super friendly and fast with our wants and needs.

The food was also pretty good.  Not the best on the Island but it was still a good option if you are near the kaanapali beach area.  The fish tacos were tastey and the drinks weren't bad either.

We debated between Hula Grill and Leilanis based on Yelp reviews. I am glad we choose Leilanis. I got a ""the lime in the coconut"" not sure it was my favorite, but it was different and the waiter did warn me ahead of time.  Both the boyfriend and I got the fish tacos, they were great.

We did NOT expect to end up with such an amazing dinner. We ate in the dining room (seems like the outdoor bar area is likely a different menu). Great service (Thanks, Matt!). Delicious sour dough bread. My husband had an amazing pork special with pineapple chutney, Brussels sprouts and gnocchi. He said ""Oh my god. I think this is the best pork I've ever had.""

My family has been coming to Lelani's for over 14 yrs and can not believe that Lelani's and their general manager Jason has decided to no longer offer a free hula pie for diners from the Maui Marriott. We also tried to use a coupon from their other island restaurant Kimos and the manager on staff Sam was kind enough to give us a free pie.

1/2/2016,4.0 star rating,"Very nice restaurant for a ""chain"". Cocktails were a bit watered down. Ok, maybe really watered down. So you're better off ordering wine or beer unless you really have to have one of those fruity drinks with an umbrella. 

The sashimi was very fresh and a fair portion. My son enjoyed his clam chowder (with white fish) and being from California and having visited our daughter in Boston many times and sampling many different chowders. This was up on their list of some of the better chowders. 

Our fish and steak were all delicious and prepared beautifully. The kids plates were all polished off.

If you're the sort of person that rates the upcoming food based on the bread. The bread was good. Not great. But good.

Hula Girl pie was enough for several people to enjoy. And the chocolate mousse cake was light and delicious.

They also offered to replace the turkey with several different choices of fish for any non-meat eaters which was great.

I tried the Lei's Lemonade which was citrus vodka, lemonade and splash of cranberry, but I couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  It just tasted like lemonade.  Also ordered the Beachside Nachos and it was just regular nachos with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, black beans, and cheese.  Since we were hungry, we ate it all, but it was nothing spectacular.

10/13/2013,5.0 star rating,"I was so happy we found this place. We had eaten at a couple of places that were just okay, in Maui. I searched online for reviews and found mixed reviews for here, but overall good. 

I used my yelp app to make a reservation. It was Saturday afternoon when I found them and make a reservation for 7:30pm. I was glad we were going to get in. I had put in a request for ocean view, as well. That surprised me when we got there, they had paid attention and asked us if we wanted to wait the extra ten minutes for the view. Well, yeah, I think we do. 

They gave us a pager and we walked out onto the beach and were paged pretty quickly. The customer service was awesome. We ate here twice on our stay, mainly because my husband wanted to try the dish I had the first night, which was the ono with roasted potatoes. 

We had the hula pie, which is mud pie, and I was not a fan, I know, I know, I was supposed to rave about it, but I am not a mud pie kinda person. However, my husband is and he loved it, They actually had a coffee hula pie both nights, as a special. 

The prices are really not that far off from other places we had visited but kind of on the higher end. That wouldn't stop me from going back at all, the food was great on both nights, as was the service. We asked for ocean view and we got it both nights, as well.

Perhaps less sauce would have made the dish more delicious. My fruity mango and strawberry drink was okay, I think the strawberry portion had a strange aftertaste though.

And for doing community service, she earned a card that allows us a nice discount off our dinner.  We dine here on a semi regular basis and it is definitely a family favorite.  

We were seated pretty quickly for how busy the night was.  Kendal was our server and she was friendly and sweet.  We started with 2 appetizers, the Calamari and the Fried Shrimp.  They changed the coating on the Calamari and I have to say we like the old version better.  However, the plates were attacked and cleaned before I could ever take a photo.  

Kepa was our food runner for the evening, (I have known him since he was 5 ) and we got our food, all correctly and nice and hot.  Daughters had the Kalbi Grilled Chicken Plate and the Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak.  Delicious!  And I am a feature of habit and love the Kalua Pork Cuban.  I took half home for my lunch the next day.  

Overall, it was a really great evening.  Great service, fun atmosphere.  I have to say I loved the people sitting next to us, they were full of compliments and kind words to the staff there.

We opted for it which comprise 3 course dinner menu for $26. That was perfect value for good food and view. Our waitress Mea was friendly and explained the choices. Appetizers were great, entrees (local catch preparation was good), my fillet with prawns was bit dry (I guess I made a rookie mistake of ordering it medium well). Desserts were good (we tried both the options available on menu. Sorbet contained three flavors Sweet dragon fruit, Tangy Lilikoi, and White pineapple which balanced all flavors well.

9/8/2014,3.0 star rating,"Leilani's is in a great location, and has a lovely dining room, but I am so glad that I found out they have two menus.  We ate here twice during our trip, and with a small menu, once was enough.  OK, it is vacation, but the entree prices just seemed, high.  The first time here, my wife and I each had an appetizer and a salad, along with a couple of cocktails, and it was enough food (we eat light) and the view was lovely, so it was a nice night.

When she wanted to go back, I was less enthused, since I didn't recall anything on the menu I wanted to try a second night.  Thankfully, I saw a waiter carrying a plate of fish and chips that were not on the menu.  I asked our waiter, and he brought up a menu from the downstairs, more casual, restaurant.  Frankly, I thought that this menu was more interesting, and the salad and fish tacos I ordered off this menu were both really good.  My daughter had them customize a salad for her, which they did without any fuss, and the three of us had a nice meal, overlooking the water.

They do get busy, so if you have a bid table and are there for prime time, take pity on your waiter if you do order off the other menu, as there are separate kitchens and things may not come out all together.",Matt H.,"Orange, CA",4.0 star rating

My filet was perfect, my husbands actually came out rare.  He choked it down but would have much preferred it cooked correctly.  Lobster good.  Did not have time for dessert, needed to get back to babysitter.  It took over 1.5 hours just to be served the salads and our dinners.  The delay was not on our part, we had looked at the menu online and were eager to order as soon as we were sat.  The waiter was nice but the service is just too slow.

3/20/2016,4.0 star rating,Leilani's is probably one of the best restaurants right in Whalers Village. They have booth fine dining and a casual dining. I usually order the flat iron steak or the chicken teriyaki. Love the white rice and the macaroni salad.

9/15/2015,5.0 star rating,"It's our first time to Maui and we were told a lot of good things about Leilani's on the beach by our concierge at the Sheraton black rock hotel. 
We figure we give it a try. We arrived there was a line at the front desk , Leilani's has different menus for dining areas, the two girls up front kindly explained and helped accommodate us with the dining room menu she said about 30mins for a table. We got to wander around, got to see a few shops and found a bench in their lobby to sit and waited til they could accommodate us. 

Our server was one of the best we've had so far on our trip Adam. He was a very kind young man, very knowledgable at his job. The food was great , pricey food but good portions. 
Best staff service we had along with our dining experience while on Maui. 

The only thing that bothered us was while sitting waiting for a table the unnecessary comments of a couple made to the hostesses about other people being sat in front of them , the hostess kindly said she had reservations upon arrival that were being seated, 5-10mins later they approached the hostess again rudely saying when they were gonna get sat , and made rude comments in front of everyone.
I don't know how I would be able to keep my composure in situations like that , but your hostess staff was great and seemed very professional in their positions.  

Leilanis on the beach, thank you for being one of the best serviced restaurants here on our trip. We will be back and will recommend your restaurant to fellow family and friends

6/7/2016,5.0 star rating,I loved this place. We went back twice I like it that much. I am a vegetarian so it's hard to come by dishes on the island. Had the tacos both times and loved them.

1/30/2017,1.0 star rating,This used to be our favorite restaurant on Maui. Dinner tonight was unexpectedly average and the service was less than average. Our high expectations for a fine dining experience were disappointing. Fresh fish was not well prepared and presentation did not match the menu description. Dinner was overpriced for what we got.

I got some fish tacos that were very tasty fish and good quality.  If you can catch any of their specials or happy hour you will save some bucks, but if your in Maui saving bucks really isn't the only thing right?

NOTE: The menus are different depending on where you sit, inside vs. outside.

Inside: got chicken, since it was mostly fish, chicken and steak options. Chicken was tender and came with veggies and noki. Decent but since it was bone in chicken, not a ton of meat on it to cut through. Hula Pie was good but mostly just a brick-of-vanilla with some chocolate on it.

Outside: Got Kahlua pork nachos, very good, and filling for a lunch meal to share. Got the Smores dessert and was pretty good, marshmallow melted onto chocolate ice cream and brownie.",Colin B.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

Those might be the best fish taco's on the Island.  Really delicious.  The right amount of spicy.   I added the salsa to the fish taco, and they brought Chulula sauce with them.

We made reservations and were promptly seated at a table on the top floor, overlooking the view of the beach. Between my husband and I, we ordered the roast chicken, pork shank, split a green salad and had some cocktails. 

Thumbs up:
- I was a fan of the green salad, with the local greens, soft goat cheese and sweet cherry tomatoes.
- The anuinui(sp?) cocktail was delicious and addicting. Almost got a brain freeze from drinking it too fast.
- Portions were sizeable, especially the pork shank. 
- I really enjoyed the sides on the pork, which included gnocchi, brussel sprouts and corn. 
- Service was fast, friendly and attentive, despite it being at the peak dinner hour.

Okay, I lied, I wasn't really doing all that...But I seriously recommend Leilani's.  We had lunch here right before we left to the airport to depart the most beautiful place in the world..the island of Maui.  The service was top notch, and the food was even better.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  I had a fruit and chicken salad and my husband had an avocado cheeseburger.  I know, I know..you're probably wondering why I'm making such a big deal about those simple entrees, but I don't know if it was the amazing view or the fact that it was my birthday or what..but that was the best salad I've ever had.

Came here for my girls birthday and told them it was her birthday and they didn't sing for her.... FAIL!!

Should have went somewhere else.

She had the crab legs and they were so bland. She pretty much wasted it. She ate one and left the rest. We have no microwave at the Hyatt so she didn't see a reason to bring it back.

The scallops were good. One star for that.

Oh and one thing we (4 of us girls) thought was weird was 2 of us had cards to pay with and 2 paid with cash.... The waiter took the whole check with the cards and cash and we told him exactly how much to charge on each card and then he ended up charging one card twice with both totals we told him and then left the cash? Wouldn't you have taken the cash out then charged each card? I don't know we just thought it was weird. Must be a Maui thing? Or we just watch too much ""mystery diners"" and watch the waiters and waitresses pocket the cash. Just odd to us. He correct the card mess up as well.

9/3/2014,4.0 star rating,"4 stars for Taco Tuesday, 3 stars for the regular lunch menu

We came here twice on our vacation  - once for Taco Tuesday and another day for lunch. I recommend coming here ONLY for Taco Tuesday, hence the 4 star rating. Regular priced lunch is too expensive for the quality of the food and would otherwise receive a 3 star. 

***Taco Tuesday: 3-5 pm. 
-All regular Margaritas and Pacifcos for $5
-One of their famous fish tacos for $5. 

We ordered about 2 margaritas and tacos each. We shared the Chips and Guac from the TT menu, however the size was small and I would not get them again. 
The fish in these tacos is so fresh. Leilani's  has every right to brag about these tacos because they are well worth it.

Lunch (Beachside Grill) 

Appetizer:
-Beachside Nachos with Chicken: the best thing we ate. Definitely a shareable appetizer as it is a large portion. 

Entrees: 
-Roasted Turkey Flatbread: Tasted pretty good, enjoyed the pineapple jimica salad. 
-Grilled Fresh Fish Sandwich: Way to pricey for the bland taste. Do not recommend
-Chef's Fresh Hawaiian Fish Catch
-Fish & Chips: My dad sent this back after one bite - he did not like them at all and he has had fish & chips everywhere. He ordered the fish tacos instead,

4/10/2015,5.0 star rating,"This restaurant is conveniently located at Whalers Village which is walking distance from our hotel/condo - Kaanapali Ali'i. We ate at downstairs instead of the restaurant upstairs as they have two separate facilities. Upstairs is more formal while downstairs is more casual and is outdoors. When we got there around 6:40pm, we were told it was an hour and 15 mins wait but actually was 40 mins. 

I ordered the fish tacos since everyone said it was good. I agreed. I like the fish grilled rather than breaded fried. My daughter had the Kahula burger which was huge. My wife had the grilled chicken, my son a cheeseburger, my mother-in-law had the Cuban sandwich and my mother-in-law's fiancée also had the Kahula burger. Everyone said the food was great. 

Our server was great. We also had the Hulu pie which was very good. It is big enough for about 2-3 persons. 

We got them free as we had drinks another day and keeping the receipt entitles you to free pie with two paid entrees.

Going to Maui you would not imagine eating anything but seafood, big mistake!  You have to try, just once, this great dish.  Three one inch thick medallions of mouth watering lamb with a delicious sauce.

11/28/2016,3.0 star rating,"We were looking for a place to have drinks and apps while watching the sunset. We were seated quickly, and got a table with a great view. My husband had wine, and I had a mixed drink w/vodka, lemonade, & a splash of cranberry juice. It was tasty, although it seemed to have a passing acquaintance with the vodka. I'm a lightweight, but it would have taken at least three drinks for me to get even slightly buzzed. The pork spring rolls were delicious, as were the siracha-guava chicken wings. The lackluster service is what earned Leilani's three stars. Our waiter had no enthusiasm whatsoever,  and was so low-keyed he was basically absent. We asked for extra napkins for the chicken wings. It took so long that we shared one napkin! By the time we got them, there was one wing left. So-four stars for food, three for service.",Lynn W.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

You can't go wrong with pork belly. Its was super tender and had so much flavor. The scallops was amazing very sweet and fresh plus it was  poach in butter. Damn good. Ono Citrus was cook perfectly very moist so  good. My wife got the Monchong  Miso Glaze  it was ok she said. Over all it was a good last  dinner on the island.

The upstairs view is stunning as well. Leilani's is pricey but you are paying for a gorgeous view and great people watching. Just a fun place to eat.

There is no island flavor at all like we expected. Just regular seasoning and no flavor. Please do not order any steak item in their menu. The worst steak I ever had. Rubbery, tough and could not be sliced by their knife. Served cold and tasteless. The mashed potato added to my disappointment.

I ordered the highly recommended fish tacos, which I generally love.  The food arrived in fairly short order but my tuna was way over cooked and tough and chewy.  The rest of my party enjoyed their meals.

We had such great and quick service. Our waitress, Lisa, was absolutely wonderful and made the experience that much better! We had the seafood pasta and the chefs tasting (which they do from 5-5:45) that included kalua pork spring rolls, Parmesan crusted catch of the day in a lemon caper sauce, and a trio of sorbets.

5/30/2014,4.0 star rating,"We ate here several times while staying at the Westin Resort next door, and it was great. One important thing to remember, if you are staying in Maui and eating at or near resorts, expect to pay more than you typically might - no need to dock them points for that here.

We had quality food served by an attentive, friendly and professional wait staff and that's what gets them high marks here. They did everything they could to make our vacation better and that is a great thing.

Out on the beach the Kahlua Pork nachos were great, up in the restaurant the teriyaki steak and crab legs were very good and the S'Mores Dessert was worth another trip back.

What we ordered: 
-Crab cake was YUMMY!!!! 
-Shrimp scampi was great!!! It's a different twist to it instead of the skinny spaghetti noodles I normally get at back at home.
-The daily special of the swordfish was cooked to perfection!! 

The hubby and I really enjoyed our dinner here and finished our food!!! Great customer service and enjoyed the candle light dinner when the sun was setting!

2/13/2015,2.0 star rating,"This restaurant was walking distance from the resort that we are staying at so my husband and I decided to eat here around 9pm. They have two restaurants one upstairs which is a full dining or downstairs which is a bar and grill we chose the bar and grill since the host said the one upstairs is taking last orders in 10 mins. The customer service was great but I couldn't say the same for the  food. 


Poke Salad: tasted okay, I have had better. 
Siracha Wings: wasn't able to taste the sauce of the wings since the sauce was coated lightly. 
Fish tacos: let me tell you these fish tacos were suppose to be delicious since that is what Yelpers raved about but they were horrible. They serve you two fish tacos and I only ate half of one.

We had the famous fish tacos and they were amazing! Must try! However the fish and chips were not so great and lacked flavor, the batter that the fish was fried in wasn't thoroughly mixed and had different flavors through every bite. We also had the hula pie which was AMAZING as well!! 
The service was great as well considering we had three kids with us and some picky eaters.",Nia Q.,"Hayward, CA",4.0 star rating
10/25/2015,4.0 star rating,"Giving this 4 stars because of location and the view. The dinner itself was more 3-3.5. I did not think it was as good as Keokis on Kauai. I had the nightly special which was Opa with lemon risotto, the risotto was excellent with tons of fresh citrus flavors. The fish was a little under seasoned.

6/11/2014,4.0 star rating,"We came here for our last dinner in Maui and just wanted something nice and close to our hotel and really--my husband needed beef at this point :P--he was sick of chicken and fish. 

We made reservations and arrived a bit early, but were seated shortly after. Service is pretty great at Leilani's and you can't beat the view from the 2nd floor seating. 

I had the seafood paella since I can't eat a lot of the fish they served (ono--which is high in mercury) and my husband had the prime rib. He enjoyed his dish like he hadn't had meat in a month. He ordered the extra coconut prawns which was $9.95 extra, but you only get 4 tiny prawns! They were good and the sauce that comes with it has a kick, but the price is a little ridic. 

The paella was ok. It filled with fish (which I couldn't eat) and 2 overcooked shrimp and 1 weird tasting scallop. The rice was a bit mushy for me--more like a risotto, but overall it was flavorful. 

What made me give this place 4 stars? The service and ambiance and definitely the Hula pie. I debated over the Hula Pie or S'mores dessert, but I kept seeing slice after slice of Hula pie being brought out. It was divine. It's basically a mound of mac-nut ice cream with chocolate sauce and a chocolate crust. It did get to be a bit too much--I'd recommend having 3 people to share a slice. 

I also saw a lot of people order the fish tacos, but since I'm limited to which fish I could eat, I passed on the tacos. They did look good--you get 2 to an order with some chips. 

I also like the bread basket and room temperature butter. Nothing ruins my meal like frozen butter! 

Tip: Make reservations and you can order from the bar menu upstairs!",Jennifer C.,"Redondo Beach, CA",4.0 star rating
2/5/2016,5.0 star rating,"Greg the waiter gave us outstanding service - despite having the incorrect spelling of the name Gregg. 3 g's should be the correct spelling.  I had the 1944 - their version of a Mai Tai. It was good, but I am not a big Mai Tai guy.  We were stuffed after dinner and had no room for desert.  The view of the ocean was good during the meal.

I ate there for the first time tonight and I'm certain it was the best meal I've had in the 5 years I've been vacationing here. All the ingredients were so fresh and executed perfectly. It was hard for me to pick out each ingredient because the overall harmony of the dish was so well put together. I will be returning again and again, it's worth the wait. Make sure to make a reservation because it is ALWAYS busy. Once seated at your table it doesn't take long though, they seem to operate like a well oiled machine.

Other than that, the braised pork is a TOTAL win!!! I'd definitely recommend that over everything else on the menu. The shrimp scampi is also very pleasant and tasty. The mixed drinks were nice, and the overall vibe was so relaxing that it's difficult for anything to get you down around here!

She said she wasn't hungry but she ate the whole thing. I ordered it medium and it came out well done. The fries were delicious. Great view of the sunset.

We ordered coconut shrimp and nachos for appetisers and both were extremely disappointing. The coconut shrimp was all batter and no coconut! Go to the Marriott resort & you'll get a better coconut shrimp from the bar!! Nachos were so lame because they literally took tortilla chips & microwaved the 5 blend Mexican cheese on it!! That is literally something I can do at home.

Dessert was actually good. If you stay @ the Marriott you can get a free hula pie or pineapple upside down cake.

He had the steak which came with green beans, carrots, and bacon mashed potatoes. The meat was cooked well but the potatoes were cold and the green beans and carrots were undercooked. We told our server about the cold potatoes and he quickly apologized and brought us fresh hot ones. 
I had the Hawaiian swordfish (can't remember the Hawaiian name) which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was awesome. We had the BEST server, but I can't remember his name either. They gave us a free Hula Pie since we were celebrating a birthday.

If you like red meat, then try the DOUBLE R SIGNATURE RANCH® PRIME RIB* 14 oz. Leilani's dry rubbed and fire grilled ""Paniolo Style"".  You will be hooked!  I can't wait to come back.

Ended with Hula pie which was ""to die for""!

Enjoy dinner at Lelani's and watched the sunset.

Nice!

We happened to dine here during a horrible passing rain storm and they were so kind and generous to my new husband and I. In addition, a kind and generous couple bought our meal without us knowing and we will be paying it forward before we leave Maui! They'll never know how much that meant to us but if they happen to read this THANK YOU! It meant the world to us!

7/26/2015,5.0 star rating,"An Exciting and Flavorful Adventure!

Each time we come here there is no possible way you can be disappointed. The last time I came, I was shocked that they were taking their pumpkin soup off the menu the next day (I guess visitors don't want soup in 90 degree weather :/ ) 

The #1 thing on their menu that is also on the lesser side of being ""expensive"" are the Fish Tacos! I highly recommend them for lunch. Dinner, like usual, is always busier than lunch so remember to make a reservation. Also, attire at night is a bit dressier than during the day. 

Last time, I ordered the Sesame Crusted Ahi Steak and I ate it so fast that I almost cried over the fact that I didn't spend more time enjoying the flavours of it. Served with coconut citrus jasmine rice, kula asparagus, and smothered in an unbelievable shiitake-soy butter sauce (even our waitress said she would drink it!) 

The service was fantastic, and our waitress was the absolute funniest! On a side note, don't forget to ask your server to validate your parking ticket.

If you are lucky enough to steal a spot on the balcony area, the sunset is amazing, and you are less than 30 feet from the ocean. To top it all, their hula pie was one of the best I have ever had (except we had to battle over it, as there was 6 of us). Leilani's is a must go!",Noah G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",4.0 star rating

This is a good place for people watching as it is located off the beach and you can watch beach goers pass by. This place was super crowded and definitely a tourist trap.  Service staff is okay.  We had a dirty look from one of the waitresses as we were carrying our stroller downstairs.  She was a heavy set person.  We walked into the main dining area, but it was closed.  The beach dining area was open for dining, but it is located down a set of stairs from inside the building.  We carried our stroller down the stairs, and it blocked this waitress' path.

They have a casual restaurant environment downstairs, and a more formal restaurant, by Hawaii standards, upstairs where they serve dinner.  Go at 5:30 for the ""early bird"" specials.  Same food lower price.  Both are prefect for catching the sunsets.",Nancy G.,"Edmond, OK",4.0 star rating

My fish tacos were excellent was very impressed with flavors, quality of fish, sauce was perfect spicy The only thing I would change was the tortilla  to a home made corn tortilla... Then it would have been best fish taco I have ever had.  I would go back again and get same order.  Also the Mai tai was very good all home made ingredients no pre mix.

10/3/2015,5.0 star rating,"UPDATED:  I should have named this ""The Two Sides of Leilani's,"" but I didn't realize that this place is just a little schizophrenic.  We loved our experience last night so much, we returned tonight.  But instead of showing up, putting our name on the list, and window shopping for 30-40 minutes, my husband was able to secure us a reservation online.  What we learned through this experience is if you just show up, you sit at ground level near the boardwalk.  This part of the restaurant is definitely more casual, with a bar, television, and casual food.  On our return, we were looking forward to trying some of the other items we saw on the menu....only, the reservation was for the ""fine dining"" side of the restaurant.  Different views (from the balcony, you can actually SEE the ocean), more formal atmosphere, and a different, more upscale menu.  I showed up dressed pretty casual, and didn't take long to realize that I was a bit under dressed.  Same place, but two different experiences, both delicious and enjoyable.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Can I give this place 10 stars?!?  We almost didn't come based on mixed reviews I read on Yelp.  But after a sunset cruise, we found ourselves on foot, in the area, and HUNGRY.

For starters, this place was BUSY....I mean, tourists EVERYWHERE.  This made me a little nervous, but we went ahead and put our name on the list and then checked out the shops while we waited for about 40 minutes to be seated.  Our server, Derrick, was outstanding.  Few servers are able to strike that ""just right"" balance of being attentive without being intrusive.  And the food....Oh.my.goodness.  So, so good.  I ordered the fish and chips and hubby ordered the fish tacos.  Both were perfectly cooked and oh, so tasty.  Even though the area was super crowded, the ambiance was great, surrounded by families and folks enjoying themselves, and right there by the beach.  

I almost forgot to mention dessert.  Derrick recommended the fresh tropical fruit crisp a la mode.  The perfect end to a perfect meal.  Given the location, I admit that I was surprised by how affordable the food was.  Highly recommended.",Chris T.,"Cerritos, CA",4.0 star rating

12/21/2014,1.0 star rating,"Horrible host service. We made a reservation, came on time and were given a place at the very back of the restaurant next to the rear exit (which was open). We asked for a different table which we noted was un-taken, but the person took so long to check, they put someone else there. They told us that that party had reserved that specific table (unlikely because it was a non-descript table in the middle of the floor). Then the host came to tell us that a reservation doesn't guarantee a decent table, and we could wait 30 minutes for a better table if we liked, and suggested we take the table we were given. 

I feel if a restaurant cannot handle basic customer service, it's not worth eating at. We just got up and left and decided to eat at the Westin Oceanside next door, where they also had a 30 minute wait but suggested we wait on the sofas, apologized for the delay because the kitchen was overloaded and generally were very nice about it.",Haris H.,"Kirkland, WA",4.0 star rating

We heard from several people that the fish tacos here were the best in Maui but after seeing their $19 price tag on our first day, we decided to hold off. After a few more people recommending their tacos, on the 7th day of our vacation we decided to check them out. The service was great, the view was great and the tacos were pretty good, but in our opinion, the tacos were not the best that we've had (we've eaten fish tacos pretty much every day for lunch since being here) and most certainly not worth the $19.

As you sit at your table, you will enjoy the people watching, beach goers walk along the path enjoying their day on Kaanapali Beach.  My girls also were amazed at all the little birds looking for food.  Within a second these little birds will happily clean up after you, it's somthing to witness!

The food here was very fresh and they have a huge selection. What is really nice about Leilani's is that they are essentially 2 restaurants; the upstairs and downstairs have separate menus.

The downstairs restaurant is always busy, probably the busiest in the area and there is usually a 15-30 minute wait. My recommendation is to sit upstairs because there is a better view and no wait. I also like the upstairs menu more, but if you want something from downstairs you can still order it.

I would definitely recommend the King Crab legs! They were awesome and I have not found King Crab legs anywhere else. My wife really enjoyed the daily catch.

The calamari was outstanding! 
I am not the person who is too fond of tacos. But I loved them there!
The salad that was served with fish and chips was just awesome!

Our dinner at Leilani's was our last dinner in Maui, and choosing Leilani's was definitely the right choice. I made a reservation through Open Table (which you can only do for the upstairs dining room, not the downstairs more casual outside area). We had a great table ""on the rail"" which a perfect view of the sunset. I ordered the tuna steak which was one of the best I've ever had (and I love tuna).

While we were waiting (not an overly long time, and they give you a pager so you can walk into Whaler's Village if you care to) I heard a couple gentlemen talking about the fish tacos.  We were seated in a nice location--sadly next to a table with unsupervised children running amok, but they were old enough I could shut off my Mom-genes and ignore them :)  There was a very large football contingency in the place cheering for their respective teams, so in that respect it felt very much like Chicago.
The cocktails were good, and my son ordered me calamari, knowing I like that very much.  We also opted to share the fish tacos.  The calamari was served and it was not at all what I am used to.  I tried a piece and found it quite unappetizing.  In fairness to the establishment, the waitress noted that we were not eating the dish-- I didn't have to bring it up, and i appreciated this.

6/30/2016,1.0 star rating,"Zero stars. This place is ridiculously busy because it is surrounded by hotels. If it were located anywhere else it would have closed down by now. I was there with 4 teenage girls. We showed up at 7:30 pm wanting to eat in the casual dining area. Wait time was 45 min. I totally expected that because the casual area does not take reservations. Got my buzzer and wondered off to the stores to kill 45 minutes. Twenty min later the buzzer started vibrating and lighting up. I was surprised since it had only been 20 min, but hurried over to the checkin stand. When I handed them my buzzer they said they didn't buzz me and that my table wasn't ready. I informed them that the thing was flashing and vibrating for like 30 seconds. The hostess informed me that it must be broken so she handed me a new buzzer- crossing out my original buzzer number and writing in the new buzzer number. So the girls and I sat and waited another 40 minutes (now an hour since we arrived). I'm looking around and there is no one waiting anymore. I look and notice at least 6 open tables so I go up and ask how much longer. The hostess looks up and down her lists acting like she can't find our number. I point to our name and notice it had been crossed through???? She proceeds to tell me they were just about to buzz me, they were just waiting to get a table together that can accommodate 5 people - you know because that is so many. We wait another 10 before being sat at our table. Waited another 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. Waited 10 min for waters. Waited 35 min for food (fish tacos). When we were finished we wanted to get the hell out of there, but it took forever to get our waitress's attention to get our bill. What kills me is we could have gotten the same food at our own hotel and still had plenty of time to night swim, but the girls wanted to try something different.

7/26/2016,5.0 star rating,"We had an absolutely incredible experience at Leilani's tonight. We were seated almost immediately for our 6:45pm reservation and lucked out getting the best corner table along the railing, which looks perfectly out at the sunset. The woman who sat us was friendly and although them being busy, she was happy to take pictures for us before sending our server over. Our waiter Frank was AWESOME. We had some dietary restrictions in our party and Frank didn't miss a beat. He offered solutions for the restrictions and was not even slightly agitated. Or at least he didn't seem so:). He checked on us regularly and the food came out efficiently. The ceasar salad is a great traditional taste and can be split, if you want just a little something before your entrees. The cocktails were delicious and I would highly recommend the 1944 Mai Tai. It's the most authentic old fashioned Mai Tai I've had. Delicious! Our meals were so good and perfectly cooked, broiled, baked, and steamed. I had the off menu special, which was the onaga broiled to perfection, with grilled asparagus and instead of jasmine rice they were able to steam me some green beans and carrots. The Parmesan crusted version of the fish and all the items that come along with it was so amazing too. I would highly recommend this restaurant for the cuisine, ambiance, staff and vibe. The only thing that some might not love is that it's quite warm with only fans, however, it gives that old school Hawaii feel, which makes it almost unnoticeable within the first 5 mins.

We got the onion rings (probably the best I've ever had) and the poke bowl (also fantastic, one of the better ones we had on the island).

Fantastic drinks! They actually sold IPAs in Hawaii, shocker. My husband got one and it was great (can't remember which one, maybe Maui Brewing Company?). I got the ""1944"" and absolutely loved it. They said it was their version of a ""classic tiki cocktail"" (i.e. Mai Tai) with several different rums, fresh lime juice, orange curacao and orgeat. It was so amazing. One of my favorite drinks on the trip.

They were fantastic! Picked out calamari and Lilikoi Pono Pie. Out of this world! Service was good, right on time and friendly. Our server told us the Lilikoi Pono Pie wasn't a top seller...This surprised us, it is one of the top 3 best desserts I've ever had. It motivated me to finally download the yelp app so I could ""spread the word"". LOL. A light fresh desert, with thin moist coconut foundation... partially  reminiscent of key lime, only 100x better!

4/30/2015,4.0 star rating,"Of our four off-resort Lahaina dinners, one had to bring up the rear not so much due to their lack of enjoyment but more so due to to the high standards set elsewhere. 

Leilani's promptly seated us when we arrived with our reservation and the service was spot on, as was the wine list. 

My main downer was skipping fish to have the king crab legs which I found to be more water-boiled than steamed. Those of you who cook crab legs know what I mean... the taste was still good but the texture of the meat became a bit mushy. My wife disagreed with my assessment on this so I may just be a little harsh, but otherwise we really enjoyed everything.

We really loved the sorbet trio for dessert and I place Leilani's just a notch below Lahaina Fish Co, Kimo's, and Koa.

Of the four, my ratings:

Lahaina Fish Co.- 4.7
Kimo's- 4.5

One of the best things about this restaurant is the view from upstairs. My husband and I ordered the fish and chips. We both thought the fish was fried to long.  We had two small pieces of fish some fries. It was served with a delicious coleslaw with cilantro. I left feeling like we shouldn't have paid 17.95 each for the amount of food received. My kids ordered beach burgers, they came with fries and were 14.95 each. The drinks were 3.25 each.

6/13/2014,4.0 star rating,"This review is for the upstairs dining at Lelanis.

I had read mixed reviews of Lelanis but since we were staying within walking distance of Whalers Village I decided to give it a shot.  The downstairs menu didn't seem to appealing so we went upstairs.

Our waitress was great regarding my allergies and made sure all the dishes we ordered I could eat.  The catch of the day was snapper so we decided to split that and  the green salad with goat cheese.

Whenever you see red snapper in a restaurant just order it.  It's that good.  Our fish was cooked perfectly and came with lovely mashed potatoes and vegetables.

Since we were honeymooners we got a free slice of Hula pie which is macadamia nut ice cream with an Oreo crust.  You'll definitely want to save room for this one!

It is on the pricey side but if you share a couple of dishes it doesn't turn out to be too expensive.  Great views of Kaanapali beach as well.",Allison H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4.0 star rating

6/27/2016,1.0 star rating,"Gee. The pictures look delicious and the other reviews seem inviting, but we will never know.  After walking up and discovering the wait at ""25 minutes"" we were enticed to put our name in and commit to this place for dinner.  At the 60 minute mark it was then too late to start a dinner meal and we surrendered our alarm.  That was the precise moment it lit up.  For the uninitiated, there is a huge difference between 25 minutes and 60 minutes and it's absolutely inexcusable to be that far off with prospective diners.  It's easy to blame the hostesses for making a mistake that big.  But it's more accurate to blame the manager for being so out of touch with the front desk that this is allowed to happen in the first place.  Shameful.  It all ends up coming across like a lie. We had options.  We could have picked elsewhere.  But we were lied into committing and we ended up getting screwed.  We will be happy to advise our hotel concierge on this outcome since she was the one who is making those recommendations to patronize this restaurant in the first place.

P.S. - the very moment we handed back our alarm these same hostesses were telling an inquiring couple that the wait was only ""about 35 minutes"". This was at the same moment they were accepting our alarm knowing we had given up after an hour.",Eric H.,"Santa Ana, CA",4.0 star rating

5/24/2014,2.0 star rating,"Our experience at Leilani's was thoroughly meh. My family and I went for a late lunch / early dinner type of meal where two of us ordered the fish tacos and one the chicken entree.

To start, the restaurant was super loud because they had their performers hooked up to big speakers in what amounted to quite an intimate setting (outdoor porch with not too many patrons). It made it such that it was almost impossible to maintain conversation and seemed a bit silly considering the size of the space and the number of people in the restaurant.

The fish tacos I ordered were meh to okay. The fish was semi-fishy and was just plopped on the other layers of the taco, almost as an afterthought. This next point is a bit picky (and definitely personal preference based), but they used flour tortillas for the tacos instead of corn and I thought that the taste sometimes overpowered the other flavors in the taco. Also, I asked for no cheese on my tacos (it didn't really seem to make sense with the flavors) and they came with cheese. Womp womp.

My dad ordered the chicken dish and really didn't like it. It ""had a tough life,"" which is his way of saying that it was tough to the point of being almost inedible. I will say that our server very kindly took it off our bill when we told her about the problem.

Sirloin also had Maui onions next to it. 

Lamb ($34): pretty good, flavorful. Sirloin (premium grade, $26): very tender and had good flavor. Mashed potatoes was good. Steamed veggies were ok. They also packed some warm dinner bread/butter, which was nice.

Their MaiTais were slightly less potent than Sea House's in Napili Kai, but still refreshing and good nonetheless.  As this is a popular and excellent restaurant located near numerous high-rise vacation hotels/condos, reservations are definitely recommended...and if you end up parking in the Whaler's Village lot, make sure you remember to get your parking ticket validated...an otherwise $18 parking fee ended up costing us only $2 with validation.

The server was extremely odd, he wouldn't make eye contact with us when he spoke, very inattentive and down right weird. We ordered the poke to start, it was delish! My niece orders the monchong and I had the Ono. My fished was extremely overcooked and hard as a rock. My nieces fish was cooked perfectly. I tried to find my waiter for 15 mins to send my fish back. He finally came by and I told him I was bummed about my fish. He didn't say a word and literally took my plate and walked away??? He didn't offer me a new plate or anything else. Come to find out later he removed the fish from our bill. I think he should have offered me a choice. I settled on hula pie for dinner dessert since my fish was swooped up from me.

Avoid the Nachos, its a small serving and the added cost of meat ($4 for a few chunks of chicken) wasn't worth it.  I thought our server was good, she was handling several tables and kept on top of them all.  Drinks are overly spendy and weak, stick to the beer as you know exactly what you're getting.

4/18/2014,4.0 star rating,"The short version: 
Leilani's has excellent food and very friendly staff. There are also amazing views of the ocean and the sunset which raises the price of the food. The wait staff is friendly but can occasionally be ""on Hawaii time."" 

If you want to know more: 
The only thing separating it from the sand of the beach is a sidewalk and a minimal amount of green grass and lush bushes. Which makes it a convenient place to get out of the sun and into a refreshing cocktail/the shade during lunchtime, depending on your preference. It also makes it a nice restaurant to relax in and catch the sunset while eating a delicious and fancier dinner entrée.  
Wife and I went to the beach bar and grill and liked it a lot.  Then the next day or so went to the dinner side of the restaurant and liked it a lot again. For lunch, we had kale salad, sriracha-guava chicken wings, and fish tacos.  And for dinner we had crispy maui onion crusted wahoo on a bed of rice with brussel sprouts and a creamy gouda sauce. Also a grilled Salmon Creek Farm pork chop with a chimichurri sauce and  whipped sweet potato and market veggies.  I would be excited to eat any of this food again. It was all excellent. 
The few negative aspects were that occasionally there were long periods between seeing our waiter. It was a busy night for the restaurant though. Also, as a result, they were out of a few things like the fresh hand-churned butter that went with the delicious sourdough bread so it's a bad thing that sheds light on a great thing. 
The price is basically what you can expect for what and where it is. $25-35 for an entrée. $15 or so for fish tacos.

We were seated in the open-air dining room, on the edge with prime views. The service was on par, every employee was smiling and friendly, offering upbeat greetings of 'aloha' and 'mahalo' at every pass (yet not in a forced manner). 
In my opinion, the decor and the wait staff uniforms were a bit dated and took away from the ambience.
I had two cocktails, the Pineapple Express and a Lime in the Coconut. The first was the better of the two, the second tasted simply like coconut water and not much else. (I would not return for the drinks alone.)
We shared the poke (poh-kay) bowl as an appetizer (aka 'pupu'). It was fantastic....fresh, flavorful and paired so nicely with the taro chips. Also, the right portion size for two.

We spoke to a local at another restaurant and he recommended Leilani's. He said although he's a waiter there he would highly recommend Leilani's because the food is so good. Unfortunately the best part of our experience reflected a beautiful ocean view from upstairs but the food not so much.
When I asked the waiter if the vegan burger was good and if he had it before he said he had eaten it before and would recommend it, so I ordered it. The bun was gluten free but the consistency more like cardboard. The burger patty was definitely a frozen job and I was very disappointed.

They had live music playing which was nice and the Staff were just as pleasant as anyone could be. The service was good but to be really honest, we thought the food left a lot to be desired. The prime rib was just a bit warmer than coming straight out of the cooler. As prime rib goes the taste was below o.k., but serving it at room temp. or colder just wasn't very pleasing. I was so hungry I just grinned and bared it, I should have really sent it back. My wife's steak had a little bit more flavor but the outside was seared and the inside was raw as raw could be, she ordered it medium and the outside was medium/well and the inside was rare/raw. Nice environment to kick back and relax but we will never go there again for a meal. I think because of the crowd the kitchen was just pushing out orders as fast as they could. I'm assuming the prime rib was already made, so they made my plate while waiting for the steak to cook without putting under a warmer. Then the steak was cooked on very high heat, so the outside was seared that left the inside raw. Sorry, when seeing the ambience there I really hoped it could be a higher rated restaurant.

The staff strategically placed all patrons in areas not to get wet from the rain and strangely the place was packed but no one got wet. The meals flowed quickly from the kitchen and the bar was bustling with many counter goers. The waitress was pleasant and made sure to check our validation for parking.

The service was great, the food was great, and the drinks were even better. We were seated just in time to watch the beautiful sunset. My husband had the fish and chips and I had the turkey sandwich. I don't eat fish so I can't tell you how the fish and chips were, but the sandwich was delicious, as was the jicama salad it came with. We were there for Happy Hour, during which time they serve a drink called Hawaiian Punch and it tastes exactly like that, minus the chemical taste the kid's drink comes with. Being it was my favorite drink as a kid, I loved the drink. We then had the Hula Pie. We ordered it thinking we would have a couple of bites as we were both stuffed, but we ended up eating the whole thing as it was that good.

1/15/2013,3.0 star rating,"Just for Happy Hour.

On our first day in Maui, after checking into the hotel, we walked along Ka'anapali Beach and went into Whalers village.  The three main restaurants here all offer some type of happy hour deal but we saw the $4 drinks and couldn't pass them up at Leilani's.  We were seated in the outdoor patio right on the beach, the view is something that is unbeatable.  Sitting right there with the ocean breeze, people watching and enjoying the locale, it is definitely a great experience.

In terms of happy hour, the drinks are pretty good but the service isn't.  It took forever for our waitress to come over and even greet us.  When she finally did come back for our order, it was like she was in a rush.  Finally, when we were still finishing our first drinks, she plops the check down on our table because her shift is about to be over and she wants the tips.  Not even going to ask us if we want another drink?  We quickly left after that.

Also, the patio is beautiful for us humans but also the wildlife is well aware of all the food in the area.  There were birds everywhere, there was bird poop on my chair (which the hostess didn't notice) and bugs everywhere.  Guess it is on the beach but hopefully they could've done something about it.

Had the roasted sweet potato and veggie platter, which I really, really enjoyed, esp the lua leaves, and the bf had the short ribs which was nicely cooked. Nice, hot, freshly baked loaf of bread to start.

Views are outstanding, can't get any better than that. 

It's in the Whaler's Village, which is a nice little place to mosey around and shop, although save your money on the little touristy knick-knacks, they are charging WAY too much. Go to downtown L'ahaina down the street for things that are 50% less.

10/7/2014,5.0 star rating,"This was probably our favorite place we dined at while in Maui. Whether we walked up from the beach in our swimming suites, or we wanted a nice dinner, Lelani's had what we were looking for. Ask for Mea if she is there, she was probably one of the most delightful servers we have ever had!

Let's start with the layout. Be mindful they have a dining area (more formal), and Lelani's on the Beach which is below, and is the more casual dining experience. Also, note that they both have different menus. If you are looking forward to their legendary fish tacos, you will have to dine at Lelani's on the Beach because they don't serve them above (although, on our last night, we convinced our server to give them to us in the restaurant). Get the tacos with guacamole, and they have two great Mai Tais. They even have $5 tacos on Tuesday. 

For dinner, you can't go wrong. If you love tuna steak (always go rare on the island) and spicy, they have a great tuna steak, but be warned, it has a kick! They also have very in depth knowledge of the catch of the day - taste, texture, etc. We never went wrong when we dined at Leilani's

They are also part of a group of restaurants (I think Hula Grill is too - see other review) where if you bring in your previous receipt, you get a free dessert - Hula Pie. Their Hula Pie is a great cap to a warm day. It's a gigantic piece of ice cream sandwich pie on steroids. It's oreo cookie crust on bottom and top, 4-5"" of vanilla ice cream on the inside, topped with chocolate fudge, a mountain of whipped cream, and sprinkled with macadamia nuts.

Can't go wrong with Leilani's!",Bryan K.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating
6/26/2012,3.0 star rating,"After reading reviews on Yelp, I could not help but look forward to trying their Hula Pie. This place is not specifically known for their Hula Pie but it was my first time hearing about it through here. So I decided to come here for dinner with my bf. I would make reservations just to be safe just because it can get pretty crowded.  For appetizer, we ordered a crab cake, which is probably one the best I've had. It had a little more kick and flavor to it compare to other types of crab cakes I've had at other restaurants. It's a little expensive but it's worth a try. 
For my entrée, I ordered baby back ribs. Unfortunately, the ribs did not quite work out for me. It was dry and hard to chew on. After all, it is a seafood restaurant so I should have known better and ordered fish or king crab instead. Of course, the whole time I was waiting for the moment of the Hula Pie. We were lucky that night that they were offering free Hula Pies (whoa!) so we got one on the house. Quite honestly, it's not as exciting as it sounds. Imagine a huge Carvel icecream cake with extra layers of icecream and crunchies on the bottom and whip cream on the side. That's basically a Hula Pie.  But whatever, it was free! (Thank goodness.) Just make sure you carry a bottle of Tums or Rolaids because it can upset your stomach if you're lactose intolerant. Overall, the food itself was a 3 for me. 
As for the service, we had a waiter who seemed to be constantly distracted and I guess because he had a lot of tables to serve that night and it was quite busy. The food took awhile to come out but being on vacation mode, I didn't really mind at all. Either way, he was nice and friendly like most people in Maui. If you're talking about a romantic ambiance, this place certainly gives you that. I'm not talking about a really formal candlelight romantic but more of a beachy, casual romanticism. What I also like about the restaurant is that it faces the beachwalk along the Ka'anapali Beach and it is constructed like a beach house.",Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0 star rating
8/9/2015,5.0 star rating,"I was in Maui for my honeymoon, and my wife and I were looking for a place to eat at the end of our trip. We had been to many of the good restaurants on this part of the island, and we avoided Leilani's because of the Yelp reviews. On this night, though, I wanted lobster and Leilani's had it on their menu. We were hesitant, but we went.

That turned out to be a fantastic decision. This place is incredible, and I have no idea why it has lower ratings on Yelp than comparable restaurants in the area. This was our favorite place that we ate at. The lobster was amazing and so was my wife's parmesan crusted catch of the day. They also had phenomenal cocktails (the Southern Squeeze was delicious). We also had the most friendly waiter of our vacation (Brian), and he was very knowledgable about the menu.

All around, it was a great experience. We decided to write a review because we don't want other people to miss out on how great this place is. Someone told us that they recently got a new chef and it is much better now, so that may be why some of their reviews reflect negatively.

4/29/2016,4.0 star rating,"We had already enjoyed a casual dinner at Leilani's Beachside Grill so we decided to give Leilani's on the beach, their less casual restaurant, a try for dinner. The Beachside Grill has  steak and fish selections (one of each) but it's mostly a pupus, burgers, sandwich and drinks spot. It has a great location for people watching and a nice view of the ocean with catamaran's coming and going right up to their location. Well worth a try. 
The dining room at Leilani's On the Beach is upstairs and if you get a table directly above the Beachside Grill has a great ocean view. Let me say you absolutely want to make reservations in advance (which we did) or be prepared for a long wait for a table. I ordered the chef's special fish of the day which was monchong, pan seared and served on a polenta type side that had some olives and capers and was surprisingly tasty. It didn't look all that appetizing at first but it was quite good. Monchong is a very delicate fish and when prepared as it was is a bit mushy for my taste. It was good but I kept wondering if it was cooked as I'm not a sushi fan. My wife had the Jidori chicken which she liked but she especially enjoyed the Maui Pasta Co. gnocchi which accompanied the chicken. 
We ended the meal with Kimo's mud pie which is always a treat. If you haven't had it yet get to Kimo's or Leilani's and have a slice, you'll thank me.

For the food the Fish House Chowder - Fresh Island Fish, New Potatoes, And Clams - is great and might be the thing that brings you here to begin with. The Maui Fresh salad - Mizuna greens, Hana fresh tomatoes, Surfing Goat cheese, lilikoi balsamic - is quite good too. The night I was there they had Mahi Mahi for the Miso Glazed Fish & Shrimp with Black forbidden rice, Thai coconut reduction. It was good too, however, I think the reason for the three stars is that the food was not good enough to push it into that realm for me and on top of the food the place has a high volume, chain food, feel to it -- at least for me.",John R.,"Warren, NJ",4.0 star rating

You have a plain view sight of Kaanapali beach, and the whole atmosphere is relaxed and ""islandy.""  I wouldn't call it true Hawaiian food though...more like Americanized.  However, if you want a quality meal, this would be a nice place to go.

5/15/2014,2.0 star rating,"This place has Maui's famous ""best fish tacos on the island"". Sure,  the fish was very good and quite hearty.  The problem I had was that if you're going to have two tacos for $16.00, I expect them to be phenomenal.  The soft shell wasn't crisp or even warmed,  and the toppings were sparse.  My wife's $11.00 ""loaded"" nachos consisted of chips with plenty of melted cheese,  and light sprinkles of the rest.  She added chicken for $4.00, and got about seven tiny chopped pieces (see attached photo). We each got one beverage.  Our lunch total was over $50.00 and we left feeling extremely unsatisfied.

I have to give it 5 stars because of one particular person - the manager Laurie or Lori (not sure spelling -sorry!). I didn't have very high expectations being at the end of the night and almost closing time. We were seated by the hostess to the bar area and the waitstaff seemed to be really busy. Laurie noticed that we didn't get our orders taken right away so she came over and helped us herself, apologized for the wait and was the quintessential professional. Very warm and embodies the aloha spirit. 

The location is convenient to those staying in Kaanapali strip, right in front is the beach and part of Whaler's village shopping area. The onion rings were good and the ahi tuna was so fresh and melt in your mouth delicious, like it just came from the fish market, even at the end of the day!!!

Special, Margaritas and Mai Tais); and $4.00 sliders (6 choices, about 4"" in diameter) served a la carte.

Knowing we didn't want to fill up, we were reluctant to order appetizers or a salad but Frank offered to split the salad for us which was perfect.

In my opinion, the prices are similar, but the food preparation, presentation, and the service is so much better at Leilani's. I'm just talking about their dinner menus here, not the bar menus. If you want to splurge on a nice dinner, with great views, and great service, I would suggest coming here and sitting upstairs! Although their dinner menu has something for everyone, the seafood dishes are probably the surest bet here. They far surpassed the dinner we had at the Hula Grill this time. I had the seared Ahi Tuna, medium rare, and it was the best I ever had. Also, at Leilani's, you cannot sit in the bar area and order from the dinner menu.

They give a large portion of fish on tacos and I would say that is the best dish I have had.  The calamari appetizer was worth having too. The location of the restaurant is the best part - the ocean and tiki torches make up for the average food.

My husband and I tried many of the comparable restaurants around the area and Leilani's was by far our favorite in terms of food quality and pricing. Everyone knows that vacation food is way over-priced, but we thought the prices here were the most reasonable for a sit-down restaurant. 

FOOD:
We ordered the same two dishes every time we came here: Fish Tacos and Kobe Burger. We just couldn't get enough! 

DRINKS:
My husband always got the Mai Tai here and said it was very strong. Which is great because you get your money's worth! I am pregnant so I enjoyed some non-alcoholic beverages like their delicious smoothies and flavored iced tea.

7/5/2014,2.0 star rating,"Our experience on Leilani's more formal upper deck last night was disappointing.

I asked our waitress if the kids' smoothies had dairy in them and she said no; it was just ice and syrup. We get a strawberry one and it is very clearly a MILKSHAKE complete with whipped cream on top! Thankfully my son (16 months old) doesn't have a sensitive stomach, but we avoid dairy for personal reasons and expect this to be respected by waitstaff.

I asked her if the pasta with cheese sauce (also on the kids' menu) has an alternative topping that's dairy-free and she says ""butter"". . . I don't think she understands what it means.

I tell her I have a nut allergy and she brings me a salad with something that looks like pesto on it. I ask her if it's pesto and she says yes. I ask her if it has pine nuts and she says she ISN'T SURE and goes to check. Luckily it didn't. But how can you bring food to someone with an allergy and not know if they're allergic?!

3/11/2015,2.0 star rating,"This review is for their beach grill below. Aloha hour is crazy. It is a mob scene, but the deals are non-existent. We waited for a table for 20 minutes. Our buzzer went off but our table was still not ready. Others had the same frustration. We ordered the aloha hour chips and pico for $4. If it were free it would still have been a disappointment. A handful of chips, a small cup with a few chunks of tomato and onion, and one piece of cilantro... at least they had Cholula sauce to pour on the chips. $5 draft was nothing to get in line for. when we were finally seated the service was OK. They were busy and tried to keep up. My Cuban sandwich was OK, and my wife's fish and chips was OK. For all the great restaurants in the area, we wished we would have opted for elsewhere.",Todd R.,"Lewisville, TX",4.0 star rating

I ordered the chicken stir fry type dish and my other half ordered a cheeseburger. It took a while for the food to come, but eh - no worries - the place has a great location right along the beach walk. 

When my husband's cheeseburger came out, it looked like someone had sat on it. It was squished. I asked him how it was and he said cold. We would have sent it back, but my husband's not that kind of person. And our waitress was a bit MIA.

My chicken dish was actually VERY tasty....! I don't eat macaroni salad, so I was a bit hungry at the end still... :-/

Now for the drinks we were not sure on a beer so the waiter brought us the beer + a sample of something we might like & told us we can ""change"" if we don't like the other one; which we did expecting that they won't charge [it was on the bill & I was in no mood to ask for them to remove it]

Its right next to the beach and a very convenient spot for anyone staying at or near the resorts. The quality of food is great and the menu has many choices for everyone.  You can sit upstairs or downstairs, which is a little more casual, but food options and service is outstanding at both. Highly recommend the second level for sunsets!

8/4/2011,4.0 star rating,"One of the sit-down restaurants at Whaler's Village, Leilani's is a solid restaurant with a great view (like pretty much every other restaurant on the island), but that's okay! We were a party of five and we were seated upon arrival, and this was around 5 pm when the restaurant was pretty packed. 

Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on our table to make sure we were enjoying our meals. We ordered an appetizer nacho plate, which was covered in cheese, black beans, guacamole, and pico de gallo. The chips were fresh and crispy and the plate was gone in no time. For my entree I ordered the Ono fish tacos. The plate came with two large soft tacos and a side of pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole (the last two were added at an additional charge). The fish was fresh, well-seasoned, and worked well with the cheese and shredded cabbage inside the taco. Add some hot sauce for an added kick! My drink was a lemonade & cranberry juice combo, very refreshing.

9/4/2013,3.0 star rating,"Overall, Leilani's seems to be hit or miss. The hostess seems to have an attitude but our server was wonderful and took good care of us and our kids. 

We ordered from the Olala menu ($20 entrees from 5-6pm with smaller portions). My gnocchi was slathered with pesto but I didn't taste any basil. My wife got the Maui Onion encrusted  fish which was delicious! 

The kids had a similar experience: the grilled chicken was very tender but the Keiki Ribs were the opposite of 'fall off the bone' and left my son picking at his teeth. 

For dessert, we split the famous Hula Pie which is essentially a huge slice of a pre-made Macadamia Nut Sundae. Not bad (and a deal at $8) but nothing to write home about.

Located next to the Kaanapali beach and Whaler's village, Leilanis is a great option for a casual dinner (downstairs).  Service is fast and friendly and has a great atmosphere.  You can hear the waves crashing, Hawaiian music in the back ground and tiki torches illuminating the dining area.  

The burger her is REALLY good.  It was very flavorful and cooked over mesquite charcoal or wood.  I also had the Cuban sandwich with kaluah pork.  The waiter suggested adding avocado (which I thought was odd but went with this suggestion) and it was delicious.  The avocado mutes the salty and smokiness of meat and really complimented it.

12/23/2011,4.0 star rating,"May 2011: Tony and I dined here twice and enjoyed our evenings. Both times we started the evening at the bar drinking tasty mai tai's (served by Johnny). They were very good but a little pricey and I think the ones at the Hale Koa in Waikiki were much better. 

Food is very good. One evening we just sat at the bar, talked with Johnny and ate a couple of appetizers: Fried calamari (very good and lightly battered) and the nachos with Kalua pig. Oh wow, they were the best nacho's I've ever had! Of course, the tender pork made the dish. 

Johnny asked if we had our receipt from the previous night. We did, so we were given a complimentary hula pie for dessert. He later gave us an extra receipt for this evening to use another night. The hula pie was rich and very filling with its oreo-like cookie crust, ice cream, whipped cream, and topped with chopped macadamia nuts. 

For the other evening, we sat at a table listening to the live music, watched the sun set, and enjoying our food. I had the Kalua pig Cuban sandwich and a salad; Tony had the Kobe burger with a salad. Everything was excellent. 

Prices are reasonable, as this is the casual part of the restaurant. Their main dining room is expensive and probably worth the splurge. 

Overall, I do recommend this place for good food and good fun.",Monica P.,"Frederick, MD",4.0 star rating

3/1/2012,2.0 star rating,"My boyfriend and I had just landed in Maui. We were walking around Whaler's Village and came into Leilani's for a quick bite. It was a nice day so we decided to sit outside in the bar area right by the beach.

As I was looking through their menu, the Sunnyside Zucchini Sticks stuck out to me. Got an order of the zucchini sticks, I got the Fish and Chips, and my boyfriend got the Burger Duo, which gave you two burger choices from a small list (he chose teriyaki and jalapeno).

The zucchini sticks I liked. Sliced length-wise, fried with little breading, and served with a side of ranch. Hot, crispy, and really good. The Fish and Chips were a major disappointment. Dry and the breadcrumbs they were covered with didn't go well with the fish. Not that it mattered at that point because they were way overcooked. My boyfriend's burgers weren't all that great either. The burgers were cooked they way we wanted them, but whatever topping they put was sparse, as if they were running out and trying to reserve as much as they could. The teriyaki burger had this dinky little chunck of pineapple and a sorry squirt of teriyaki sauce. The jalapeno burger had like 3 little pieces of jalapenos in the burger. Seriously?...

When ordering drinks, I tried the Lava Flow (yum yum yummy!) and he had a classic Mai Tai (haf plenty of rum but he was expecting more sweetness).We didn't get there until right at the end of sunset so we couldn't really see the ocean but the ambiance with the tiki torches was perfect.

Again you are pretty much paying for the view and swanky (for the 90's) vibe. The one positive here is the helpful friendly service from the servers.

8/10/2014,3.0 star rating,"The main draw of Leilani's is obvious, namely a nice Maui beach ambiance. We've been to Maui 6 times in total and always wind up coming here. The meals generally have been solid, priced correctly given the locale and for what you pay...until yesterday for lunch.

I have no problem paying more. But I do expect quality and some fairness in portions based on price. My wife had the tacos for $18. She got 2 that really are appetizers. Really? No doubt they were delicious, but this was really a nickel and dime. 

Also, our lava flow drinks could not have had alcohol. They are reasonably priced at $9 each. But I'm sensitive to alcohol and definitely knew the mixer put little to no alcohol in what were watery and sugary drinks. Consistency should be a virtue in my view here.

My fish sandwich with jicama salad was nice. The fish was fresh and tasty. The bread nicely toasted. The salad was refreshing and light. A fair deal.

I don't want to complain too much. As I said, we normally have a solid experience here. Last but not least, the service was excellent. So I'll give them 3 stars overall.

What made it so great, is that it's a casual place to eat lunch, right on the beach, and the food is great.  I particularly loved their fish tacos, but their other dishes were good as well.  The beach there is one of my favorites too, not because it's the best place to snorkel, or body surf, but it's a good combination of the two.  Our family's favorite thing to do on this trip was to go have lunch at Leilani's and from there step right onto the beach and go swimming for a few hours, though it's perfectly fine to go swimming first and then go to Leilani's.

3/28/2011,3.0 star rating,"This was the S.O.'s first dinner with the fam on the island... we managed to get reservations that allowed us to bring the nephew as well as the stroller (they were friendly about it!)

We sat next to the beach side grill and it was windy and rainy so it wasn't the perfect setting at all.

Our server was prompt and funny.

I forgot what the rest of the group ordered so I'll just do my own meal.

In a mission to find the best Mai Tai in town (the winner in my book so far is Kimo's) I decided to order their mai tai. First sip: it was really watered down! I couldn't even taste any alcohol in it and the buzz that I was hoping to get after drinking it... was nonexistent. 

Dinner: opakapaka cooked in their ""Grilled Fish and Shrimp"" (Island catch, jumbo prawns, roasted Maui onion & red bell pepper cassoulet and polenta) 

I was hoping for grilled but it was more of a sauteed fish. I didn't see any grilled marks on my fish. The hope of a light and feathery meal was gone with the heavy (tasteless) fish with it's accompanying sides. I ended up not finishing my meal at all.

Overall... definitely a touristy spot...with touristy prices. Friendly services but just OK food wise.",Cath M.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
7/10/2011,2.0 star rating,"I wanted to like this place because of its proximity to our hotel, but Leilani's disappointed me in many ways. 

My husband and I came here for an early dinner on July 4th (we wanted to avoid the Lahaina dinner crowds, as that was where we were headed next to watch the fireworks). The first problem was that we weren't even given the option of ""full menu"" vs. ""casual menu."" I am 29 and my husband is 35, but we both look quite young (luck and genetics I guess), and the hostesses essentially profiled us and assumed we wouldn't be able to afford anything more expensive than the casual menu, so they seated us downstairs without asking for a preference. I didn't realize this had happened at the time, but I'll come back to that point later. 

The food was, per my 2 star rating, ""meh."" I had the shrimp & crab melt, and most of the bread was so hard that I couldn't cut through it with a knife. The ""melt"" part was too heavy and rich. The salad I substituted for fries was a somewhat sour Caesar that reminded me of something from Olive Garden. No offense Olive Garden, but when I'm on vacation, I'm looking for something tastier and classier than that. My husband ordered the fish & chips (again, we still hadn't realized that this was only the ""casual"" menu, and it hadn't yet occurred to me that there were better choices upstairs), which I didn't taste but didn't really want to. I can't even remember what we drank because the cocktails were forgettable.

When we left, I forgot my sweater at our table, which I realized less than 5 minutes later. We went straight back and our table wasn't yet occupied but the sweater was gone. We went to the hostesses (who were having an inappropriate conversation at the podium about their personal lives) and asked them if they could retrieve it for us. One of them mentioned having seen it. Another picked up a phone and appeared to page someone in the back. The third hostess (yes- 3 hostesses and none of them were helpful) just stood there. We waited. 

While we waited, I noticed that the hostesses were asking any party that walked up if they preferred the ""full"" or ""casual"" menu. I tried my best not to get angry - after all, our meal was over, we were on vacation, there wasn't much I could have done at that point - but finally, after no one had had brought my sweater for 15 minutes, I was somewhat rude to the hostess in my reminder that we were still waiting. She finally walked back there and brought it out her self. How hard would it have been to do that right away? 

The service (aside from the hostesses) was fast and friendly, which is the only reason why I didn't give this place just 1 star. To any young or young looking couples out there: if you go to this place, make sure you ask for the ""full"" menu and a seat upstairs if it's not offered to you. Personally, I'm not going to bother returning the next time we're on Maui. There are plenty of other options on the island for dinner.",Krystle S.,"Frisco, TX",4.0 star rating
8/6/2013,3.0 star rating,"The nice thing about Leilani's is that it offers you great sunset views while having a meal. I had gotten the lava burst and the fish tacos. The fish tacos were good, the fish was fresh, but sadly I've had better fish tacos in other places. 

The lava burst- which is a strawberry daiquiri mixed with a pina colada was good, but it was just a bit too sweet for me.

7/23/2013,4.0 star rating,"Yes, it is overpriced, but what do you expect on the beach!

AMBIENCE:  4 stars.  Well, the Pacific is about 50 yards away, so that helps!  We ate in the downstairs/bar area, which was super family friendly, a bit crowded, and the sun makes it way through some spaces between the canopies--so it can get a bit hot and bright!

SERVICE:  5 stars.  We were seated immediately at the lunch time rush, our four kids at one table, the four adults at another.  Our server was there immediately and taking drink orders, and she took the extra (and much appreciated step) of clearing what the kids had ordered with us first!  The drinks and food arrived promptly.  Could not have asked for more from the server and host staff.

FOOD:  3 stars.  OK--this is where things fall a bit short.  We had the fish tacos at my brother-in-laws recommendations, and the fish was great, BUT, and this is a HUGE BUT, the tortilla tasted like a flour washcloth.  Being from Tucson, I am a bit of a tortilla snob, but that said a restaurant of this stature (and expense) MUST do better than supermarket flour tortillas!  The Hula Pie is big and awesome, the four of us split one slice and that was enough to finish off lunch for us!

DRINKS:  3.5 stars.  Standard beach fare, Mai-Tais, etc.  One cool feature is a digital thermometer above the  beer kegs that tells you how cold the beer is!.

FAMILY FRIENDLY:  5 stars.  Great with kids, great service.

We went to the upstairs area for dinner. Tropical ambiance with views of the ocean made it your typical Hawaiian restaurant experience. I had the filet mignon which was quit tender and juicy. I wasn't particularly keen on the demi glaze sauce, it was a strong flavor, so needless to say I wasn't scrapping it up with my bites. My husband had the teriyaki steak which was quit good with a pickled pineapple relish which had its intrigue. Good portions and filling with the bread they also serve didn't leave us any room for dessert.

The special was mediocre at best. I got the special fish, Opa, this fish itself was a delicate mild fish, I felt its pairing were too strong and a bit overwhelming for the flavor of the fish itself.  A green curry and fruit salsa was good in its own but it completely his the fish flavor. The filet mignon was excellent however, albeit small.

2/17/2013,1.0 star rating,"On our first night in Maui we stopped here because it was the only place still open.  We got the fish taco's that were absolutely terrible.  The fish was hard and dry, after one bite we said thanks but no thanks and had them take it back.  The Kobe burger was very tasty, but it was barely larger than a slider and cost $17 dollars.  The fries that came with it were undercooked and bland.  A pale ""blaw"", instead of a nice crisp French fry that another minute or two in the fryer would have made - but since we had already given back the tacos and I had just gotten off a plane, I had no more energy to complain.

The management was apologetic and offered some bogus excuse why the tacos sucked, ""because the burger cooked faster"".  Sorry but it takes more than a few minutes for the fish to get that gross. 

I understand that it was near closing time, but if you're going to make terrible food, just close the kitchen.  For the first night in Maui, this left a terrible impression on the local eateries.

Nice view of the beach and ocean, attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff.  Best thing - unpretentious and competently prepared food.  Now bear in mind that this place has two separate dining areas, a casual beachside grill on the lower level and a sit down restaurant on the upper level.  We ate upstairs.  We told our waiter that we had a plane to catch and he assured us that we would have no problems with getting out on time and he was true to his word, even with drinks, appetizers, main course, and desserts!  None of our food was ""fancy"" but it was by and large good.  The seared day boat scallops in lilikoi beurre blanc sauce were excellent.  The cracker and parmesan crusted monchong fish was also delicious.  Desserts were good as well.

Maui is full of ""fine dining"" establishments touting the excellence of the cuisine, the pristine freshness of the local ingredients, yada yada yada but there's something really nice about a meal where all the parts - room, table, service, food and price - work.

So, what does one eat when faced w/a new menu of options never seen before.  It was Halloween & thankfully, our waiter, a eyeliner clad Pirate rolled off recommendations with a deadpan delivery that boarded on hustle status...but given his low, muted tone couldn't be taken for a pushy car salesman.

After wavering on the seafood choices, I selected the king crab legs with mashed potatoes & steamed veggies.  My SO got a steak & lobster combo, which afforded me an opportunity to sample other items without ordering directly.  

The King Crab legs were ginormous & arrived pre-cracked (yay for me!).  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of the delicate meat that came out of the spiky textured shell.  Then, I tasted the lobster & was blown away.  It had a light crust, something bread like & enriched w/some type of bubbly gooeyness on top that didn't overpower & made me tastebuds explode with delight.  As if that weren't enough, the butter was like icing on a cake, and each bite was savored with immense satisfaction.

The reason it only got 3/5 stars is because when they have live bands, they blast the music way too loud. And a lot of the patio seating in under the sun so it gets pretty hot. The drinks also taste a little weak (except for the Mai Tais which are pretty tasty).
Beautiful view, friendly staff, delicious tacos, and the best Hula Pie ever. However this restaurant also owns 3 or 4 other restaurants on Maui which all have very similar menus, happy hours, and Hula Pies.

9/25/2012,5.0 star rating,"My wife and I LOVE Leilani's! 

We have visited them multiple times and usually enjoy the barside menu downstairs. The fish tacos are great and the fish and chips are also good. The fish and chips USED to be top knotch when they made them with Ono, but the new recipe is still good. Their pulled pork sandwich is above the norm for what you expect. 

The dessert of choice is the legendary Hula Pie. Definitely one you share, it's an ice cream pie slice with an oreo crust with gratuitous amounts about chocolate and whipped cream with mac nuts. 

Drinks are good and they have a happy hours also. Decent selection of draft beer too. 

You can't beat the view on Ka'anapali beach looking out toward Black Rock and the islands of Lanai and Molokai. It's the perfect location to see the sunset also. 

I did plan a banquet event here as well. The event manager, Kako, was very helpful and stayed in touch with me via email and phone. They were very fleixble with menus and arrangements. It was the perfect ending to our day and event as 19 of us enjoyed good food and watched the sunset from our table.",Bee Z.,"Glendale, AZ",4.0 star rating

7/8/2010,4.0 star rating,"Just so ya' know, came here only for an appetizer and happy hour during our trip to Maui. We almost never ate lunch since we were busy hiking or swimming. We came to Leilani's because it was written up in one of the guide books and being the diligent tourists we are, had to check out the spots sure to be completely devoid of all local Hawaiians. Whatever. 
We really were not trying to be your typical tourists, the copywriter in the guidebook just did a good job writing about Leilani's.

The food, the drinks...get on with it woman! We stopped in about 30 mins before happy hour ended, ordered $4 mai tais and 2 $4 sliders that were on their happy hour menu. $16 for 2 people at a mini-meal on Maui? Unheard of! 

The sliders were by no means the 'mini burgers' touted at a fast food restaurant last year. Mine had Kula grilled vegetables and feta cheese. My husband ordered the crab cake slider. In addition to the contents, the little bun set the mini-meal off perfectly. It was a small wheat bun lightly toasted and probably buttered. Gasp! (I try to steer clear of butter generally.) 

The drinks were alright, not as good as the sliders though. 

Definitely check out Leilani's for happy hour. We might try it for dinner another time.",ciara c.,"Temecula, CA",4.0 star rating
6/3/2013,3.0 star rating,"This was a beautiful place to have dinner at sunset. Right on the beach. The food was pretty good overall. But very spendy. Our waiter was busy and as a result did not come by our table very often. We waited a long time to order, and for drink refills. We eventually got our meals - fish for dh and filet mignon for me. They delivered our food and disappeared. We didn't see our waiter (or any other server) for about 10-13 minutes after the food arrived. In that time my steak and my kid's meals got cold as we waited to ask for ketchup and steak or horseradish sauce. I finally just ate my steak plain (which is how it tasted, no seasoning at all) so it wouldn't be ice cold. Very disappointed in this.

7/23/2010,3.0 star rating,"I was a little disappointed this last time around.  Last year my wife and I came here and thought it was really good.  I was looking forward to the dinner special they have in the upstairs dining area.  It was so good last year and such a great deal that we came here our first night in Maui this time and it didn't hurt that we were staying within walking distance.

I ordered the teriyaki steak early dinner special.  The steak was a pretty good size and the sides were fine, but the teriyaki sauce was a bit on the salty side.  I don't know if it was just this one night I happen to come here but by the end it was hard to keep eating the steak because it was so salty.  The previous time I had it the steak was delicious and the sauce was perfect (not too sweet not too salty).

1/12/2013,3.0 star rating,"This place is alright. For the way it looks, I honestly expected for the food to be better. I tried yelping beforehand but this place receives so many mixed reviews. But I now understand why, it depends on what pleases you. 

Location- Great. The view is amazing. If you sit on the top floor you have a nice view of the ocean and you're next to the Whalers Village shopping area so it's very convenient. 

Service- Awesome. Our server was attentive, knowledgable and made recommendations. 

Food - Meh. And that's why they get three stars. I ordered the mahi mahi citrus fire grilled. It comes with the fish, and a ""salad"" on the side. The fish was very citrusy indeed. It's a good thing I like sour stuff because it was apparent lemons and limes were used to season the fish. The little salad was more of a salsa with cubed pineapples and cucumbers. It went well with the fish and it was okay, just expected something else I guess. My boyfriend got the miso marinated mahi mahi, he said it was too sweet. The best dish was the steak my boyfriends dad got and the sashimi appetizer we had in the beginning, now that was top notch. 

I didn't try the hula pie which I regret, It could have earned them a star perhaps. The best part for me here was Mai Tai I ordered that came in a cool glass.",Janelle A.,"Anaheim, CA",4.0 star rating

The food was excellent and the hula pie was to die for!  We would take it to go and enjoy it Late at night. They packed it perfectly with the nuts and chocolate separate. Stick the chocolate in the microwave for a few seconds and you have liquid hot fudge to pour over your guilty pleasure. So good but so bad...

Both places have menus up to check out, and prices are about the same.  I saw a salad had to try at Leilani's, so we went over there.  It was huge!  It was walnut, Maui onion, feta cheese, a chicken breast, and sliced strawberries on a plate of fresh greens.  Delicious!  I had lemonade to drink, then had another glass.  It was really good too.  My husband had a really huge cheeseburger with the works, fries and a Coke.  The bird started sitting at my feet so I started tossing them pieces of salad and a few of his fries.  They were so many birds around the table when we left, I didn't want to leave.  I love birds.  But we were both full, and ready to browse Whalers Village, so I left my new friends, but promised myself if we ever make it back here, I'll definitely go back there to eat and feed the birds.

8/25/2014,4.0 star rating,"This is a review of the casual portion of Leilani's. Went in with no expectations but a recommendation that this was THE place to go on Maui for fish & chips, the beer-batter style. After parking in the paid lot at Whaler's Village (and happily realizing the parking would be validated), I and my companion made our way through the Whaler's Village shopping area to the beach, where Leilani's is situated. At 4:30 p.m. on a Sunday the fancy restaurant (upper floor) of Leilani's was closed but accepting reservations beginning at 5, but when I realized it was the lower-level, more casual part of the restaurant I was seeking, I got right in, with no wait, although the Whaler's Village area was packed with tourists and locals.

Seating is in an area that is open to the breeze but under a roof and shielded from the setting sun by screens. The trade winds blow through, but it can get quite warm, and little sparrows and flies are frequent visitors. That didn't bother me, as the food with one exception was spectacular. 

My fish & chips was incredible, with a tasty beer batter that just needed a little extra salt and chips (fries) that were fresh and hot and struck just the right balance between steak-cut and shoestring. I received two large pieces of beer-battered fish, each about twice the size of a deck of cards (or a little smaller). But my appetizer of coconut shrimp, at around $16, was a huge disappointment. I received only 6 small shrimp, about 1/2 the size of Outback's coconut shrimp, and I found them tasteless, even after dipping them in the accompanying sauce, which I didn't care for. 

I had a coupon for a free Hula Pie with the purchase of two entrees, given out by Worldmark Kihei's concierge, and boy was that ice cream pie delicious. It has a cookie crust, a tall section of macadamia nut ice cream, and a topping of chopped macadamia nuts and whipped cream. My companion and I made short work of it, even after stuffing ourselves with the fish & chips.

The atmosphere was casual and informal, with a musician singing and playing guitar, serenading the diners with old favorites both Hawaiian and country - and Eagles. The wait staff was friendly and efficient, and we were served quite promptly but I never felt rushed or encouraged to leave quickly.",J M.,"Phoenix, AZ",4.0 star rating

10/11/2012,2.0 star rating,"Wow, this place used to be fairly good. What happened?

Unfortunately, like many other restaurants on Maui, Leilani's is overpriced and underwhelming. The only good thing about this place is the location. 

We got the pork and fish sandwiches. The pork sandwich was nothing special, a little bland and greasy. The fish sandwich was downright inedible. It was so fishy that we could not even eat it. And the drinks were WEAK! My husband ordered the ""Tropical Itch""- I can see why they took it off the menu, no clue why they brought it back! The service was slow and apathetic.

Don't even waste your time or money coming here for dinner. If you can't resist, come for happy hour and order beer and anything but fish.",Erin B.,"Costa Mesa, CA",4.0 star rating

I think it was cause we had 5 kids  ages from 5-14 and 2 adults, the food was really good, service was on point, if you go try to sit out on the patios, it very stuffy in the restaurant..

If you dislike spicy foods, order with caution as they like to use some heat in a few of their dishes. If you like spicy food, you'll definitely want to make sure you order one of their beautifully spiced dishes. Two good ones for us were the crab cakes and the seared ahi tuna.

2/3/2013,4.0 star rating,"We made reservations via Open Table and for the most part, they were on time. It had been raining that day so no outdoor seating was available. This slowed them down a bit, but overall we were on time.

The place is laid out a bit odd in that there are multiple levels in which you can be seated. Some are down a few stairs, others are up a lot of stairs, some are right in the middle. I think the décor and the look of the place is a bit dated and could use some freshening up.

I thought the food was great. I had mahi mahi with the watermelon radish, pineapple and cucumber. It was a flavor I had never had nor thought of before. Beer selection is a bit limited but good overall. Wines are about 3x what you'd buy them for in a store but then again, this is Maui.

Our server, Chris, was awesome. He was so friendly that at one point we invited him to pull up a chair and join us. He didn't, but we really liked his service. He knew the menu inside and out, was no pressure and super easy going. 

I don't know that Leilani's calls me to come back. It's probably because where we sat this time wasn't that great of a view and when you're inside at night, the ceiling fans make the interior lighting almost into a strobe like effect. I'll probably give it one more try and hope for the upstairs patio next time.

4/19/2012,4.0 star rating,"Leilani's was recommended to me by a friend and I decided to have dinner there with my boyfriend.  We walked from the Westin along the beachside walkway and it was just a hop, skip, and a jump away.  Leilani's has a lovely beachfront area to sit outside and have drinks and the grill menu.  We decided to sit in the restaurant area and that was still outside but on the upper level.  

I ordered 3 glasses of pinot grigio and my boyfriend had a Mai Tai.  The Mai Tai was yummy and in a great jug of a glass.  I ordered the Monchong fish that was parmesan encrusted with lemon butter sauce and fresh veggies and rice on the side.  My boyfriend had the pistachio encrusted Mahi Mahi that was also incredible.  Both fish plates were great!  All I wanted was a nice piece of fish while in Hawaii and that is exactly what I got at Leilani's.  

The reason as to why we went to Leilani's was the rec that I got from a friend saying that the Hula Pie was amazing.  So we had to top our dinner off with the Hula Pie.  The Hula pie is an Oreo Crusted ice cream pie with lots and lots of Whipped Cream.  Wow, what a great tasting desert.

Pretty good ""Hawaii institutional food"" as a result of the restaurant being part of a larger conglomerate.  Still, we return for the location and sunset views if you can get an upstairs balcony table.

Service was ok, pleasant from a knowledgeable waitress.

So why only 3 stars or the loss of 2?  THE SMELL.  Guys (management) change the carpet.  Its either moldy, dirty, old or ALL THREE..  We sat waiting for our table on the bench next to the service windows and host desk... and almost changed our mind about the reservation.

The service was slow/non-existent. The manager did come to our table as we were ending the meal and asked who was serving us tonight. I told him I didn't know his name since we hadn't seen much of him. As an attempt to try to make our experience a better one, the manager said he would bring out a dessert for us on the house.

Depending on the drink (beer, wine, well, or margarita) it's $5-$8 which is pretty standard for Kaanapali so I'm not complaining so much about that. But their appetizer/food choices: a la cart fish or chicken (?) tacos $5/ea (and they're tiny) OR Chips and salsa for I believe $5 as well. Yup that's it. 2 items!! Why bother with a happy hour? We ended up ordering off the regular menu anyway. The pulled pork sand which was good, but the fish and chips were WAY over cooked.

We ordered the Maui Fresh salad and the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli. Both plates were seriously amazing. There were only three Ravioli, but with the rich truffle butter, that is the perfect amount for an appetizer. 

For our main plates, we ordered the Maui Style Teriyaki Steak and the Braised Short Ribs. Both main plates were as amazing at the appetizers.

The prime rib done Texas style was one of the best I've ever tasted and that includes authentic prime rib I had in Austin, Texas. I ordered mine medium and it had the perfect balance of a crispy charbroiled crust and fat. Tender, juicy grilled goodness from first to last bite.

The mixed vegetables were less than memorable. I wish a chef would take a dish like this and finesse it with as much skill as they do the focused entree. They should title it ""Phoned in Vegetables.""

The service was nothing to complain about, as I applaud the wait staff. It was overly crowded there, and they still did a good job. I'll give them 4 stars. 
The crowded patio was, yes, a little loud, but it wasn't anything to complain about. In fact, it was nice. The view was beautiful too.

The only thing that very much annoyed me was the live music. Don't get me wrong, they were good singers and all, but it was so loud that you had to shout to the person sitting next to you. It started to get frustrating after a while, because I had to yell my order to the waitress, and literally shout a what should be normal conversation. After a while we just gave up the whole yelling thing, and decided to wait to the music was over. Luckily, the singers left, halfway through are dinner, and it was much more enjoyable from there.

Get there early if you want to see the sunset or have a solid reservation because this is a very popular place for a romantic, sunset dinner upstairs in the restaurant proper.  Downstairs, on the beach level, is a nice Hawaiian style, upscale, beach bar that serves food.

Of the three restaurants at Whaler's Village, we experienced the best menu and food at this restaurant.

The food was good but so, so when considering the price.  When you factor in this is on the beach on Maui with an incredible ocean/sunset view, you are paying for ambiance, not gourmet.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, especially compared to the other two Whaler's Village restaurants.

This review is for Leilani's on the beach (casual dining).  My husband and I came for lunch and had the ""famous"" fish tacos--so-so.  The fish was a bit dry.  However, the pork tacos, which we had for happy hour (Tuesday afternoons) were delicious. Service is always friendly though sometimes attentiveness is spotty.

On the first night there was an extra drink that we did not order, and it was very obvious that the server knew she was trying to inflate the bill and her tip accordingly. She came back to the table and grabbed the open bill jacket before I even explained, and she apologized for being tired which was her reason for the mis-charge. We gave this place the benefit of the doubt and tried it again since it's a great location. This time we had charges for guacamole and for sliced avocados. It's as if the servers are trained to intentionally inflate the bill and take advantage of the tourists. It's unfortunate because they have a really good beer selection for Maui, and the food is descent. I'm usually a really good tipper, but I didn't appreciate the feeling of being taken advantage of.

8/27/2011,1.0 star rating,"This place is great if you are a tourist from a place that has no idea what fish is supposed to taste like.  We decided to try the ""fine dining"" area because we were looking for something other than bar food.  I went with the daily fish which was Ono.  The table next to us was raving about the cilantro lime sauce that came with the dish- apparently they didn't mind the so over cooked it was tough and hard to chew actual fish.  My husband went with the grilled opa and prawns.  Fish was again so overcooked it was almost inedible and the hubs said he didn't think it was possible to overcook prawns to the extent that these were overcooked.  And by the way- they were actually shrimp, not prawns.

Other points off- we ordered Mac and cheese for the toddler and a glass of milk.  We had to remind the staff that she was eating too and to bring out her meal.  They looked confused about the toddler meal despite the fact that she was grinning like a loon and forcing ""how cute!"" comments from everyone.   I won't knock more points off for the fact that the toddler refused to eat the mac and cheese because 1- she is a picky eater beyond belief 2- I tried some in an effort to get her to eat it and admittedly, it was at least on par with that stuff you get in a box at Costco and 3- there aren't any more points possible to knock off.  

I will say that our server was very nice and friendly.  Also- the tuna tower appetizer was not awful.  The maitais were reasonable.  However- all in all- for the price I paid- $84 total damage not including tip- they really could have at least only slightly overcooked the fish.

We stopped by for a drink while the live band was playing, great location nice atmosphere and good music. 
Once the band was finished we payed our tab and begun researching dinner options. We asked our waitress for suggestions on where to get a nice steak (since we were over seafood) She informed us that they had a separate menu for the upstairs and that they had prime rib which she could deliver to us on the lower beach level. Excited we didn't need to leave our seats for dinner we made our selections and ordered our meal. After receiving our first course the waitress came back to our table to inform me that the prime rib wouldn't be ready till after 6. With our apps already being consumed I was feeling hustled and misled I made a secondary decision for my entree. Once our entrees had arrived I was thoroughly disappointed, after picking at my entree for about ten minutes I asked for the check with no doggie bag. 
Upon leaving at 5:45ish I headed upstairs to use the restroom and what do I see the guest eating upstairs??? Yup Prime Rib everywhere!!!! I was pissed off now. 
Not only did we pay a nice price for a shitty meal we didn't even eat. We were misled, misinformed, treated like pay check instead of a guest.

Im a fish taco guy, if i go to a new restaurant i will always order the fish tacos first. Leilani's hands down is the title holder for best fish taco ive ever had (tried them at easily 25 different places). The fish was so fresh and tasty, had a perfect crisp and all in all was just refreshing. My wife had her first ever fish taco there and i absolutely hate the fact that she will forever be disappointed when she orders them elsewhere (shes ordered fish tacos probably 3 or 4 times since weve been back from our honey moon and she has been let down becuase shes comparing them to leilanis). a wise man once said FishOn!!",Joe S.,"Salem, NH",4.0 star rating
12/13/2011,4.0 star rating,"We ended up eating here 3 different times on our vacation. It was close to our hotel, the prices were reasonable, and the food was good (not 5 star dining, but still very good). 

We ate twice in the beachside cafe, I recall really enjoying the fish tacos and we split a kalua pork sandwich that was quite good as well. 

We also had dinner in the more formal restaurant upstairs. I had ahi tuna, and to be honest I don't really recall much from this meal; it wasn't bad nor good, just forgettable. However, the view at sunset from the upstairs patio is spectacular. It's worth having dinner at sunset simply for this alone. 

Finally, the thing I remember most from eating at Leilani's is the hula pie! I'm not usually one for ice cream type sweets, but this was so freaking good!!! 

I'd say 3.5 stars and round up to 4 for the hula pie!!!

All of the dishes were on the small side and even athe salad was probably no more than a cup and a half of greens if that. Our server was pleasant and prompt but it took quite a while probably 20 minutes for our entre salads to come out of the kitchen.

Update:   We did stop by again this morning for lunch and I tried their fish sandwich and she had the cashew chicken. It must depend on what time of day your there, we were there just after they opened. I didn't care for the fish sandwich on a bun, I like Ahi but not the way this was prepared.

4/24/2014,1.0 star rating,"We were a larger party (about 18 people total) and were sat upstairs.  Multiple of us in the group have previously worked at restaurants/currently work in a restaurant so we understand and know how difficult it can be to serve such a large group.  Our servers name was David and from the very beginning he was very rude, disrespectful and arrogant.

When he greeted our table instead of welcoming us all he asked ""how many more of us would be coming?""  We in turn let him know there were 4 more and the staff was able to accommodate (originally it was a party of 14 so now up to 18) and you could tell he was irritated that there were more guests in the group.  Upon providing the table with napkins and silverware we kindly said ""whenever you are ready we'll go ahead and place our drink order""  David's response was ""Pretty sure we've all been to a restaurant before and know how things work!?!"" which we were all incredibly taken back by!

Finally our drink order was taken where we asked for waters for the table (only of which half were provided and without refills the entire visit) and some soda/alcoholic beverages.  Additionally we ordered two appetizers at the time of our drink order knowing that the food order would take a while being that we were in a large party.

Our appetizers came out prior to our specialty drinks did - which was strange because that should never happen, but we let it slide.

Shortly after, he took the tables order - between the time our order was placed and the food was delivered we did not see our server once.  Finally our food was delivered about 30 minutes or so after the order was placed, one or two of the plates were missing and took about another 5-10 minutes to get them to the table - by that time half if not all of us were close to finishing so we asked the waiter to please prepare the bill and drop it at his earliest opportunity as we were in a rush to make a catamaran boat cruise.

Again, David made another crude remark saying ""Yeah someone on the other end of the table just asked for it, I will get it to you as soon as I separate it into your two checks (9 and 9 - by the tables - which we asked at the very beginning of the meal if that was ok and he agreed)""  Since I was all the way at the opposite end of the table, I clearly did not hear the other guest in our party ask for the bill so I simply apologized and said ""Sorry I didn't realize someone had already asked..."" and he rudly interrupted me and said ""yeah they did and I will get it to you after I drop these dishes off"" - it was very off standing and made us feel that he was just working our table for the guaranteed 18% service charge that was added to the party.

He dropped the bill and we paid and then left the restaurant to attend our boat excursion.  Upon us leaving we heard him tell one of the other waiters that we were ""a-holes"" and ""you're glad you didn't take that table""

While the men in our group were waiting for the women to finish getting ready for the boat cruise one of them called and spoke with the manager on Saturday.  They assured us that David is one of your best servers and that he may have just had an ""off day"" we re-iterated the story I just wrote above and the manager provided us with a $75 promotional credit to come back and have drinks or food.  The manager was great and extremely attentive - they listened, addressed the problem, provided a solution and assured overall happiness.

10 of us decided to give Lelani's another shot after speaking with the manager - we came in Sunday the 30th to get drinks at the bar and were greeted by your manager on duty - I think his name was Andrew? I am not sure.  He was INCREDIBLY accommodating and extremely apologetic. He assured us that this time our service would be above par and how service typically is.  We thought great!  So went to the bar where Johnny was our Bartender and he too was phenomenal - very accommodating and went out of his way to make sure we had a great time.  We were very happy upon heading to our evening dinner reservation at Hula Grill.  We closed out our tab - which Johnny ended up comp'ing for us (was $80 and we had a $75 credit - and we gave him a generous $40 tip) and headed over to dinner.  Ended up we sat outside and some of the tables were not covered so two of the men in our group came back to Lelani's to see if we could get a table that was covered and have dinner there. 

Again the manager was extremely accommodating and put together a quick table for 10 for us to enjoy dinner.  David happened to be working that night and simply walked up to the bartender (directly behind where the two men in our party were standing) and said ""Watch out for those a-holes- I served them yesterday""

Upon that comment the two guys in our group thanked your manager for all of his efforts, kindness and overall generosity and service for the evening and then explained the final and last experience.",Stefanie M.,"Long Beach, CA",4.0 star rating

The atmosphere is beautiful.  3rd time there and each time we requested the upper floor outdoor table against the wooden railing so we have front row seats to the sunset while we eat----and they delivered AGAIN.  The staff is so incredibly nice there.  Our waiter gave us a free Fried Zucchini sticks order....it was amazing! The zucchini tasted so fresh and was cut medium slices (not thin and wilted like most places) and it was fried perfectly with very light batter.  Their ranch dipping sauce was superb.  Our waiter noticed my BF not eating his side risotto and offered to bring him any side he wants cuz he wants to make sure we enjoy our meal  =)

We both cleaned our plates up.  Had a very nice glass of Riesling that tasted perfect.  Watched the sunset.  It was romantic.

12/4/2009,3.0 star rating,"Good food. Decent prices. We ate in the bar though - the dinner menu seemed a bit pricey for tourist fare. Yes, it's a tourist restaurant - as other reviews have pointed out that's not a bad thing. It's above average bar food served right on the beach. So beware the Mai Tai seekers...  Sashimi was good though - and very fresh.

My main gripe was that you cannot order from the main restaurant menu in the bar, and the same goes for the restaurant - two different kitchens? Then call them two different restaurants. But as a courtesy to your diners let them know that - they don't tell you that on the website or before they seat you - so make sure to ask to see both menus before you sit down.

Still staff was accomodating (we ate in the bar and asked our waiter for bread - that's a restaurant perk but he still went and got us some without a fuss).

They'll validate your parking ticket, which is convenient as well. On the whole, I'd just suggest avoiding the whole area unless you're specifically looking to walk from your hotel in Kaanapali or you want to spend too much money on average food. 

I got the Hawaiian style burger (teriyaki and pineapple), and my husband got a rather good crab sandwich (it's not on the online menu anymore). In fact, it was the crab sandwich that was really the highlight of our dining experience there. 

If you want a highly touristed, over-priced restaurant you're in the right area. If you want something that is frequented by locals and costs significantly less for way more food, go to Kihei. It's a short drive and you're liable to have a much smaller crowd, less traffic, and better prices.

Our very picky son wanted a burger and even though the restaurant didn't offer them, our delightful waitress went downstairs to get him one. When it came it had white cheese -- we were going to make him deal with it but she noticed and come over and said, ""Who puts white cheese on a burger anyway?"" and got him a new one with American cheese.

Third, the restaurant has a beach front grill for faster and cheaper food options.  Plus they have a standard restaurant with better options for steak and fish.  Both menus are good.  And you just can't deny the Kimo's Hula Pie being served here.  If you're staying on Ka'anapali it's nice to get this island treat without having to go to Lahaina.

10/10/2011,4.0 star rating,"An excellent little place to grab a quick bite.  The fish tacos were very delicious, with just enough spice as I like it.  What really sold me on coming here was the Hula Pie, a very large serving of some sort of ice cream pie with a very delicious macadamia nut and chocolate topping.  

There's a lot of different things on the menu.  Have the fish tacos. Our server, a very friendly woman named Amy, recommended them and they were a very wise choice for my last meal in Maui.

A very pleasant surprise was the view of the sunset from our seats.  Not as good as some of the other restaurants I've eaten in Maui.

We had a stir fry that was very tasty -- lots of veggies and chicken -- and a salad with lots of fruit. I was skeptical about the strawberries, but they were really good in there!  Also, we found a coupon for a free hula pie online -- that was awesome!! It is a nice cookie bottom with ice cream on top and thick, thick fudge over the ice cream. And you get a very, very generous slice. It was so good -- especially after being in the sun. 

The one down side was the birds. Lots of people feed the birds and they are a little aggressive.  I'd suggest sitting a couple rows back.",Jen G.,"Santa Monica, CA",4.0 star rating

Okay, now, I could seriously eat these tacos EVERY day...and we did eat there a second time later in the week. Portions were huge, my husband and I split one order which was one taco apiece.

This time we got inside right away and got a table in excellent position for eyeing the beach and doing some good people watching.  We took advantage of the good ""aloha"" $4 drink and appetizer specials.  We tried the beef sliders and the pulled pork sliders.  Hubby enjoyed his red draft ale, and I had two margaritas, both with only a splash of tequila in them.  Seems to be par for the course around these parts...drinks with no actual alcohol in them, but it was happy hour...what did I expect?  Beware: The sliders only come one per order and are the size of a McDonald's child sized hamburger.  They were tasty, but nothing exceptional.  We needed more to eat, so we ordered some nachos off the regular menu.  They were topped with lots of cheese and toppings, but not too flavorful.

All in all it was fine.  Come for the cheap watered down drinks, music, and people watching.  The happy hour sliders are just ok.",Carrie G.,"Davis, CA",4.0 star rating

9/10/2011,4.0 star rating,"I came by here since it's in Whalers Village so it was really close to our hotel.  Yes, it's touristy so the prices are a tad high but the food is decent. I had their Kalua Pork Cuban sandwich that came with tomatoes, cheese, onions and aioli.  While the pork was tasty and well seasoned there were some pieces that were too large making it hard to eat and a bit dry. My husband had the teriyaki burger which came with a grilled pineapple in it - so good. 
Overall, it's better than I expected and since it's in a tourist area you do pay a premium but you do get a view of the beach and you are in Hawaii, after all.",Tanya N.,"Mountain View, CA",4.0 star rating

3/3/2012,2.0 star rating,"Don't waste your time.

Food: Subpar.  I had the Cuban and my family had identical fish taco plates (supposedly the best on the island).  My cuban was flavorless and only salvaged by a boat-load of Cholula.  The fish in the taco was overdone, and kind of bland.  It seemed like they cooked a piece of fish and wrapped it in a tortilla.  The guacamole was not worth the $2 extra.  

Service: TERRIBLE!  Like seriously, our waitress Lisa passed us by at least a dozen times without even glancing at us.  We had to ask her for refills on our drinks, she was really just kind of awkward and seemed to care more about trying to flirt with her customers than take care of them.  

Ambiance: This would be the one thing that Leilani's has going for it.  Unfortunately the view was hard to enjoy with the waitstaff's boisterous horseplay, and the fact that they weren't taking care of any of their tables at all.  

Some positives, because I'm an optimist.  The view at noon was spectacular.  It would be breathtaking at sunset.  The hostesses were on point!  One of them, and I wish I got her name, new exactly where to put us ahead of time, she was out cleaning tables, she was professional all around.",Dave D.,"Landstuhl, Germany",4.0 star rating

It gets really crowded after the sun goes down so be prepared to wait (I think we waited 40 minutes for a table for two), or go right before sunset and watch it while you are eating and probably have no wait.

I think the dining room has a more romantic setting so my family and I definitely wasn't prepared since we just got off the airplane.  As a free starter they have sourdough bread and its really good its really fresh and they give you butter to go along with it. I had the sesame crusted ahi tuna i got it rare because it is sushi grade. It was good but the sesame seeds got annoying after awhile . I think my family and I ordered all of the fish entrees and they were around 20-30 dollars per plate. We also got the hula pie, now that was amazing and I still crave it sometimes

The restaurant is right on the beach in the Whaler's Village. My husband and I were staying in The Whaler located next door and was only a short walk to the restaurant. after waiting 5 minutes for our reserved table on the railing to open up we were seated with a fantastic view of the ocean, some sail boats, the beautiful sunset, and even a whale that poked its head out of the water ever few minutes off in the distance. 
I ordered, i think it was the monchong fish, cracker and parmessan dusted and cooked with a lemon caper reduction. Best fish I have ever eaten!
My husband ordered the tuna and also loved his meal.
For desert we ordered the hula pie on recomendation from a friend when they came to the restaurant. So yummy! Cookie crust bottom, macadamia nut ice cream middle (and a lot of it), fudgy top layer, drizzled with chocolate sauce and macadamia nuts on top.

I started with a fantastic wedge salad. It was ice cold and the blue cheese was rich and tangy. I had the mahi mahi & shrimp with polenta and Portuguese beans. My wife had the macadamia nut and spinach salad and the pistachio encrusted mahi mahi. We both loved the food and the ambiance. Our very attentive and helpful waiter brought us free hula pie for our anniversary.  We enjoyed it as we watched the catamarans coast onto the beach from the dinner cruises.  It was a perfect evening that we still reminisce about.

We loved Leilani's so much we came back for lunch 3 days later.  We started with beach nachos--delish!  I enjoyed my fantastic fish tacos and my wife loved her avocado sliders.  We topped off this great lunch by sharing a piece of the the 7-layer chocolate decadence cake. Wow, it was incredible.

I went with the Beachside burger, a mai tai and nacho appetizers. All of these were decent, but slightly overpriced. The burger was similar to what you'd expect: better than McDonalds, but not a gourmet burger. 

So certainly nothing bad, but nothing that would make this location a destination.....except they do have spectacular views here. Similar to a number of places in Maui, this restaurant is just off the beach and if you sit on the back patio, you can have a great view of the waves crashing in.",Doug C.,"Seattle, WA",4.0 star rating

I said I will wait and she said ok. She took my name and again asked me to eat at the bar and again I said no . Then said she was out of pagers and I told her she managed to give the other people one. Basically I was not welcome as a single person and she made it clear. Thank you. You made my night . Here I am ill and took time to be my self . To enjoy a few days. I always came here when I would come to Hawaii. For over 30 years.

We have been going all of these years because of the best fish taco's on the island , 2004 $8.95, 10.95, 12.95. 14.95, 16.95 huge wonderful Mahi Mahi tacos. I just ordered tacos to go, while I waited I had a ""small"" glass of wine, when my order arrived it was very wrong and was sent back ( thank goodness I looked ), after waiting 37mins. I then ordered another glass of wine, to wait for the correct order to come. Now, just left there, and it was $18.95 for half the size of the tortillas ( which means half the size of fish in the tortilla ) small little tacos, with awful fish. (I don't care if it's fresh or flash frozen, same thing ), My bill was 42.00, and of course have to tip 20% even though I stood the whole time,  I happen to live here on Maui and am in resort services, I will never ever refer anyone there again.

12/31/2013,3.0 star rating,"My husband and I have been here a couple times. The ambiance is very nice, the service has been good. The last time we were there, my husband requested a 'corner' booth because it was our anniversary. We were seated at a corner booth right next to a long table full of very loud, drunk and inconsiderate women. We did our best to deal but we couldn't. They were just too loud. At this time, the floor manager saw us and asked if we were happy with our seats. We said NO. He could tell. He promptly moved us. I appreciate that he had the doubt and came by to check on us. Our waiter that night was AWESOME. He couldn't be nicer, more attentive. He made the dining experience for us. 

Oh yes, and the Food. I loved our food the first time but not so the second time. I tend to experiment new dishes, so the risk is on me. Knowing this place, I think I will stick with old favorites going forward. 

Overall, it's a nice place. The service is probably better than the food, and ambiance is just as good. Come for a relaxing or romantic time, but leave high expectations for food at the mainland.",Lauren S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
7/24/2011,1.0 star rating,"BLEH.

I can't figure out what the worst part was. First off, we made a reservation for 7:45 and STILL had to wait. The hostess told us it wouldnt be long but got us a buzzer anyway...? We waited about 15 minutes in a crowded lobby sitting on the rocks (in a dress, mind you, which really hurt my... you know.)

When we finally got seated around 8:05ish, we got a pretty nice table, ill give them that. Kind of in a corner, but we had a partial view of the beach. It was VERY crowded, and had a cafeteria feeling to it. The restaurant was WAY too large (like a cafeteria) and we just felt like we didnt get any care.

Our waiter was sweet, but didnt really know what he was doing. Specials werent mentioned until prompted, drinks took FOREVER to refill (after 2 or 3 asks for a coke i finally got my 2nd one). I was lucky i even got to drink my drink... 

... because my friend's drink had hairs in it. No, not 1 hair- but hairS. 3 or 4. Dirty as all hell, too. After all of us gagged, we complained to our waiter. He picked up the drink and left and the manager came out. He only compensated us our drink.. UH, DUH, THANKS. Ive been to places that have messed up less than this and have comped me an appitizer/lunch/SOMETHING more than just another drink (that they messed up in the first place).

Food was terrible. Tomatoes were green/had stems, beets tasted canned (not surprised if they were), vegetables were awful. Tasted frozen/no taste OR way too salty. Like I said, cafeteria food.

My steak seemed like it was cooked too fast. Raw on the inside and crispy on the outside. Yuck. We wanted to walk out. It was THAT bad, and I dont usually complain. 

After our eyes almost popped out of our head following looking at the bill, we left. Gladly. Wanted to run screaming to the people sitting on the balcony to leave while they had the chance.

The crab cakes were by far the best ive ever had! They were very thin moist and crunchy at the same time and the salsa they serve with it is awsome. For an entree we got the crab legs and split the shrimp scampi (a little bland but still good). We split an amazing hula pie for desert! It was so good we went back the last night of our trip and got the same thing (except my husband got ribs instead of the scampi) and loved those as well.  Both times it came out to be about $125 (keep in mind we get 2 appetizers, a couple drinkes, 2 entrees and desert!)

It is situated in an AMAZING location on the beach and it is easy to get to if you are staying at one of the properties on Kaanapali.  We had eaten dinner at a place just across the courtyard from Leilani's and found their food to be almost identical but Leilani's was MUCH more costly.  At Leilani's we ate at the dinner place upstairs (not downstairs where the cost is slightly lower for some odd reason).  I had the steak which was very good quality but the person I went with had the Seafood Paella and it was a very small portion and was as costly as my fillet was.  Overall, it gets a 'meh'.

12/18/2012,2.0 star rating,"Draft from my visit on 6/20 that I forgot to post:

I saw this place the other day when we went for a swim. I thought it looked nice situated on the beach. We came back last night. We were seated right away. It was crazy windy out and our waitress stopped by to see if we wanted drinks and stated that it as extremely windy and were we sure we wanted to sit where we were because if we move this is only one of her few tables. Odd, but I guess I understand where she is coming from. 
I ordered the fish tacos.They were awful. The most effort that was put into making them was warming the tortillas. After warming the tortillas it looked like someone squirted the mayo/tarter sauce out of a gun ino a strip in the center of the tortilla. Next, a little (very little) cabbage was sprinkled on top of the sauce. Then the fish, which was a nice portion but so overcooked, dry, dry, dry. I opted to not have chesse. It was a sad, pale plate of overpriced mediocre tacos. Basically I smothered the crap out of the taco in chuhula sauce. That was my saving grace. Situated next to the tacos lay 6 tortilla chips. Yes 6, there were so few I counted. Glad I didn't want any chips. To accompany the 6 chips was a small ramekin of pico de gallo which looked anemic, I didn't even bother trying it. 
The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because of the hula pie. It was ok. If you like vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, macadamia nuts and whipped cream in the shape of a pie, you'll like it. Honestly the best part of the pie was the cookie crust, that was yummy. 2 stars for the hula pie crust.",Sarah M.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
3/3/2011,2.0 star rating,"The food is not really that great and it's on the overpriced side but when in Rome ... after all, you're in Whaler's Village in Lahaina which means you're paying tourist prices to look at the view.  The restaurant is operated by the same folks who own Kimo's and I'll just say the food here is a smidge better than at Kimo's.  We all ordered a version of surf and turf or fresh fish & everything tasted decent but nothing was particularly good or memorable.  

That would have all been fine but our server was a little much & took this place down to 2 star territory.  I don't mind affable servers but only if conversation is invited.  Every time our server came to our table it seemed like he talked for 10 minutes just to tell us about dinner specials, etc.,  It got to the point where each time he walked over everyone at our table exchanged looks of annoyance.

I was excited to try the Fish Tacos because according to fellow yelpers, it is a must! Upon arrival, we were seated upstairs and presented with a menu that was totally different from what i have been reading about. I asked the Manager (I think) about the fish tacos and kobe burger, and he informed me that I was talking about the menu downstairs?!! Who would have known that ONE restaurant would have TWO different menus and TWO different kitchens. Thanks hostess for telling us about the two different menus when we called to reserve a table! Anywho, the server Lance decided to accommodate us with the bar and grill menu. I thought oh what a nice guy! I was wrong, the entire time, he made us feel like second class citizens because we were ordering from the Bar and Grill menu instead of the Steak and Seafood menu.

We made reservations and were seated right away upon arrival.  Like Kimo's on Front Street they have a second floor and a look out over the water.  Instead of sitting us close to the look out, we were stuck in the far back.  We waited a long time for our drinks from the cocktail waitress followed by a longer wait time for the main waiter.  People who were seated after us were attended to before we were.  

Finally our waitress came around and took our appetizer and entree orders.  We started the eveing out with the jumbo shrimp and scallop sate.  That dish was really good and left me hopeful for the rest of the meal even after the horrible service.  But yet again we were left there waiting forever.  I know people run on island time but damn I am starving.  Finally our entrees came out.  Joe had the baby back ribs after seeing another patron tear into them.  While I took the waitress's advice and ordered the grilled fish and shrimp in a red bell pepper sauce.  Joe seemed to enjoy the ribs but the presentation was lackluster.  My fish was really mushy and the sauce dousing the plate was lackluster.  I ate only half of it and had it sitting in front of my face forever since you guessed the service blew chunks.

Although the flavors were great, the overall experience was just OK. We also got the coconut shrimp appetizer and both gawked at how small the portion was. 5 shrimp, which is fine, but on the plate it just looked like not enough bang for the buck [at least, not worth $13!!].

*live music 3 stars
*the setting on the beach 5 stars
*tourists that had a little too much to drink 1.5 stars (only because my 20th something daughters didn't like the balding men in their aloha shirt s and tight shorts dancing to the 70's music being played by the band)

2/26/2013,4.0 star rating,We came on a recommendation by a local and had the fish tacos which were very tasty. It was nice to have something lightish. We sat at the bar and got amazing service and the guy who served us went out of his way to work super fast and get us bread and anything we asked for.  Also it was the cheapest meal we had all week (in the area there). Oh and we noticed they have good drink prices too.,Dean M.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",4.0 star rating
7/30/2010,3.0 star rating,"The first thing I want to say is GET THE FISH TACOS!  They are some of the best I have ever had.  If it wasn't for this dish the place would get 2 stars, maybe even 1.  Be sure to ask for extra sauce on the side as they have been skimping on everything lately from portions to the sauce on the fish tacos.  Without the correct amount they will be slightly dry but with the correct amount they are mind blowing!

Leilani's used to be hands down our dinner of choice when eating out.  Over the years we have slowly seen this establishment go downhill.  The first mistake they made was removing the ribs from the beachside grill menu.   Portions size has also steadily declined on everything from fries, nachos, and chips.  Service is OK.  Sometimes I will get a really good server but sometimes they are terrible.  I even had a bad run in with one of the managers.  

Despite all of this the tacos keep me coming back, they are that good!  If this place was just a taco stand it would get 5 stars.  The fact that they include a large amount of inferior dishes on the menu and that the resteraunt has been in decline drives down there ratings.  I need to figure out there seasoning and sauce for the fish tacos!

The hula pie for desert is also delicious and you usually can get a free one through coupons you get from eating there or striking up conversation with a friendly waiter or waitress.

The view is also amazing, right on the beach!",Ryan J.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

9/25/2008,3.0 star rating,"I used to live on Maui and never been to this place.  I can see from past reviews I wasn't missing too much.  I went for lunch with my family so maybe I didn't get the menu or experience I was expecting.  Or maybe it's just I'm so local and enjoy food in a styrofoam container too much so my opinion is a bit skewed.  Nevertheless, Leilani's was ok.

Lahaina has TONS of tourist and is located right next to Kaanapali beach, so this place is normally pretty busy.  No exception to the day we went...but we got a bunch of tables for our family of 12 easy because my bro sells commercial kitchen stuff to them.  We sat at the Beachside Grill...kind of out of the main dining room with tables that have umbrellas, really nice if the day weather is great.

The menu has a lot of different starters and appetizers from fresh sashimi (market price), Buffalo wings w/BBQ rum sauce ($11.95), to the Beachside Nachos ($9.50).  We had the nachos and they were ok.  Nothing spectacular to write home about, I get the same thing at the local diner.  But the fresh guacamole on it made it stand out.  Their lunch menu has several different salads, sandwiches and burgers.  This time around we tried the Beachside Burger ($9.95), the Big Kahuna Burger ($11.95), and the Grilled Ahi Burger ($12.95).  The kids had their own menu of cheeseburgers, chicken fingers, hot dogs, and fries but I'll just focus on the main menu.

The Beachside Burger was pretty hefty at a half-pound, I just wish they added cheese to it!  It comes with lettuce, tomato, Maui onion (better be!) standard.  You can add cheese, bacon, avocado, or grilled onions for 75 cents each.  Comes with fries too.  The burger was good but standard in my opinion because you can get a burger like this almost anywhere.  But the Big Kahuna Burger was a winner.  It was what the Beachside Burger should have been.  You still get a half-pound burger, but you get bacon, Swiss, grilled onions, and avocado on it.  Sooooo good!  I had to cut it in fourths just to get a good bite, bad boy was huge.  I can't comment on the Grilled Ahi Burger because I didn't get to try it (thanks to the piggy bro of mine) but it sure looked fresh and had a nice piece of seared ahi.  

You can't go here without trying the Hula Pie!  Yes, Leilani's has the Hula Pie just like Kimo's...because they are part of the same company.  So ono!  The oreo pie crust, the vanilla ice cream, the fudge, and the macadamia nuts all go together in sinful harmony.  This one is big enough to share!  Good thing for us that day, the Hula Pie was on the house!  4 of us were able to share a slice with no problem...and they gladly made us 3 slices for our party.  I think it was the highlight of our lunch.  Well that, and the pretty girls in teeny bikinis!  

But I digress.  Not a bad place for lunch if you want to stay by the beach and can afford spending a little bit extra money for your food.  But then again, I've lived on Maui a long time and there isn't many places for cheap food next to the beach.  Heck, there any many cheap places for food on Maui at all!",Chris A.,"Las Vegas, NV",4.0 star rating
2/3/2013,3.0 star rating,"Although the service here was fantastic, the food was average. My husband and I have been to many restaurants in the area and perhaps we are pickier because we are from LA, Cali... 

My husband had the baby back ribs and I had the filet mignon. He really liked the ribs, but they came with a side of sweet potato fries (which we normally love) and they were really soggy to his disappointment. He didn't even eat them. 

The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, but I did add a bit of salt and pepper to it which made it very enjoyable. Although we were not disappointed with our meals, I give the place a three because the food seems very comparable to all the other places we have been to and we do not feel the food is above average.

However, the location, ambiance, and service was above average. We might return, but at this point we are still searching for a dinner spot in the area that has us say ""WOW, this food is amazing.""

9/7/2008,4.0 star rating,"Came here after coming down from my UFO Parasail adventure! We were seated outside, once again beach side. I had a lava flow and me and the BF shared fish tacos. They were so-so, too much cheese for my taste but I had such a ravenous appetite, I gobbled the thing up. We spent a little over $30 for lunch which was kind of a lot considering what we got, but they get an extra star for the view, for convenience, and for the nice waitress who served us. 

Sounds like a lot of people got heisted from a view, but that was never ever a problem for us in any of the restaurants we ate at in Maui. We were always seated in the tables that overlooked the beach. I just thought that they seat you as close to the view as possible by default. Could it be that if you appear to be a local, there is slight preferential treatment, or is it mere coincidence?

Crab cake appetizers were slightly spicy -- just as promised -- and excellent.  We each ordered the fresh fish of the day, from a selection of two or three fish and a couple of means of preparing for each.  All found our dinner to be just what we hoped.

I will keep this short... Hula Grill across the walk is the far superior of these sister restaurants.

3/23/2010,2.0 star rating,"Let me start off by saying, this is a family restaurant.  There's nothing particularly bad about my experience here.  The food was ok, the waiter was friendly, the atmosphere was buzzing.  We wanted to be close to home, and decided to try this place out.  It was packed on a Saturday night, and glad we made bookings.  

We had salads to start.  Nothing particularly interesting with spinach, bacon, and hard boiled egg.  The beet and goat cheese salad was good as well.  For entree, the grilled au (swordfish) and shrimp was good.  The swordfish was mildly firm.  The 2 medium shrimp one can get pretty much anywhere, and thus felt generic.  It came in a bacon cassoulet.  Interesting pairing for a seafood dish, vaguely tasting of BBQ pork and beans.  The beans though, I have to give credit, were al dente and not mushy, and the meat was large chunks of slab bacon.  Our other entree was the cracker/parmesan dusted monchong.  Our very friendly waiter sold this as the best dish in the house.  While the monchong was great, the cracker/parmesan 'dust' was barely there.  Again, ok dish, and remember, this is a family restaurant.

For drinks, we decided to go the frou-frou cocktail route.  The mai tais come in a fat tiki glasses, with a big wedge of pineapple and paper umbrella.  Dark rum and lots of fruit juices.  If you are in that kind of mood, knock yourself out.",Henry S.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating

We had to wait as we were walk-in's, so we meandered to the bar. I quickly gulped down 2 Lemon Drop Martini's. Mmmm. Service was pretty fast and the bar was packed! Impressive.

Once we were at our table, we started with the Calamari Strips. One word - YUM. 

I ordered the Chicken Cashew Stir Fry for dinner (totally blanking on my husband's meal). The chicken was overcooked, but the flavor itself was pretty good.

7/4/2010,4.0 star rating,"When we got here we decided to eat at their outdoor seating. We came around 6:15p so we did have about a 35 min wait. (not bad, we just took that time to walk on the beach barefoot) At first, the hostess station seemed a bit confused, but nothing to worry about.

After we were seated, they ended up putting 6 of us around a table for 4 but, no biggie. The outdoor seating forced us into this seating arrangement, and there probably wasn't another option.

Because we were in outdoor seating we got the limited and more budget friendly menu. I ordered the Fish Tacos, my wife ordered the Fish Sandwich. 

When my fish tacos arrived I must admit the presentation was not impressive, but the flavor for such a simple dish was actually outstanding. There was a blackened fish (Ohno?) inside, with cabbage, cheese, and a special tartar sauce. It was served with a meager helping of chips and pico de gallo , but after finishing the meal it was quite satisfying. 

My wife's fish sandwich was also great, having  very clever chutney type top on it served with some yummy fries. 

There menu is very unassuming, but they've got it where it counts: good service, delicious food, and great value for a town used to ripping off tourists.

The kahlua pork nachos were very good, if a bit greasy.  (Then again, they're nachos: they're supposed to be greasy.)  The drinks were also very good, albeit overpriced as is every fruity/slushy/umbrella drink on Maui.

We sat downstairs to get a nice view of the sunset, which didn't disappoint.  The downstairs area apparently has more of a bar feel to it than the upstairs dining room, but wasn't too loud or crowded.

As usual I ask the server for best burger recommendations. Instead of suggesting on of the many burgers on the menu, she keeps pushing the ""amazing fish tacos - you won't be disappointed"". Ok, I'll go for the fish tacos. Well I was very disappointed... Fish didn't seem fresh (frozen) hidden in huge flour tortillas with lots of cheese, lettuce & way too much chipotle mayo. Fresh salsa on the side had no bite or flavor at all. Sad that I didn't order that burger!! Also highly suggested was the hula pie. Huge slice of pie to share, but I could tell it had spent way too much time in the freezer. Ice cream was crystallized & grainy. I realize their menu is geared for the masses (tourists).

9/22/2011,3.0 star rating,"I used to work in Whaler's Village and ate here quite often for lunch because of the mall discount. I know one of the bartenders so he was cool but you never knew what you were going to get in terms of service away from the bar. The quality of the take-out food is the same as it would be if you ate in the restaurant. I have been served in the restaurant a few times, nothing memorable...most of the stars are for the view.

The fish tacos are good, but not THEBESTEVER like most people rave. Especially for the price...they need more spice! The fish is as fresh as can be, not always cooked to the same proper consistency...I also like their happy hour sliders. I never come here anymore now that I don't work in the village, but I do think about those tiny burgers from time to time. I also recommend the chicken stir-fry (heavy on the sauce, but great variety of ingredients) and the turkey sandwich (this one really is ono...never had a better on on Maui).

It really, really bugs me this place has no diversity in their staff..it is intentional, as I know from people who have worked there, that they promote a certain ""image"" to attract a certain clientele. Even though they have some lifers who are cool and put up with it, I don't respect their image ""requirements"" (they make the guys cut their hair if it gets ""too long""...including gorgeous chin-length, healthy, curly hair...really?

12/29/2009,2.0 star rating,"Kaanapali's restaurants in general are incredibly expensive for mediocre food and terrible service, and this was especially true of Leilani's!  

It was very crowded, very full and the waiters were all either frantically running around (we saw several near-collisions) or sort of wandering like they were lost.  

There were no vegetarian dinners at all.  The salad I opted for was tiny and didn't match the menu's description remarkably well.  Everything was typically expensive, and not nearly as good as one would hope.

The worst part was the service.  You sort of expect to be ignored some, but the guy was remarkably unhelpful.  One thing that is totally inexcusable is not bringing out everyone at a table's food at the same time.  It is not that hard!!  Leilani's one-upped that failure and just completely forgot my  stupid salad, the waiter threw the other food down and escaped as quickly as possible and then nothing until we miraculously flagged down the waiter!",Emma W.,"Phoenix, AZ",4.0 star rating

My husband and I honeymooned in Lahaina recently and ended up eating at Leilanis THREE times. We ate downstairs once, my husband said he had the best fish tacos he has ever had. The atmosphere was very relaxed and nice. We ate twice upstairs, the sweet potato meal is to die for. I didnt know what I was going to think of the laua leave at the bottom (or whatever they were) but it was perfect...and theres nothing like a purple potato anywhere else. One thing that stood out most to me was the perfect service we received on our first visit. We had Aaron as a server, he was so attentive. Anytime my water was even close to being empty he was there filling my glass. But he did it in a way that he never had to interrupt the conversation I was having. He was absolutely fantastic. On our last night in Maui (we went for 10 days) we decided to go back and eat upstairs a second time because it had become our favorite place of the trip. We asked for Aaron but his section was full and it was expected to be over mean hour wait for him.

6/6/2010,4.0 star rating,"We had dinner twice at Leilani's and both times were very very good.  We were told that their lobster tails were excellent and who ever told us that was right on.  They were oven roasted, which made me think dried out, but totally opposite.   Very succulent, moist, and didn't need lemon or butter to help the flavors.  Calamari strips were good, different.  The local brewery selections were good, bikini blonde and Big wave golden ale were my favorites.  My wife got the tiki souvenir cup and the manager Jason was quick to give us a new one wrapped in a box ready for the luggage.  

On the second trip, I had eaten so much fish that week that I saw a guy eating ribs and went with that.  The ribs were good, not great but good.  They were cooked right, sauce was good, so no complaints.  There was a group of four of us and the manager Jason (Fork Em!! Devils) waited on us the last night and he threw in all 3 desserts + extra ice cream + coffee in gratis....WOW that was pretty awesome of the guy.  I like Leilani's, it's got great views of Kaanapali Beach, food was great, and the service was awesome.  We will definitely be back next year for some lobster and hula pie!!

We were able to sit on the patio both nights we ate here and were washed over by the sheer beauty of the sunsets!!! It was amazing!!! Not only did we watch the sunset, but we dined on the most delicious burgers I have ever had! 

They were double Kobe beef burgers, topped with sweet Maui onions, American cheese all on a sweet Portuguese bun. WOW! I have never tasted a burger more perfect in my life. 

Now, I would have easily payed up to $20 for a burger of this caliber. But this little beef gem was only priced at about $11. WHAT A STEEL! 

After you gorge yourself on delectable Kobe patties, make sure you stuff yourself to the gills with their Hula pie.

6/4/2010,4.0 star rating,"Food was Great
Hula Pie was even better!

We sat at the beachside portion (seemed more relaxed) and had about a 20 min wait for a table on a Saturday Night vs the 45 min wait for inside. We just took our buzzer and walked the 10 feet to the ocean to kill some time, there are also shops you can go check out while you wait. 

Cajun Rubbed Fish Tacos were amazing as our friend had already informed us and we now concur.  Korean Style Steak was also very flavorful, the bf doesn't like steak and was a fan.

And then what we (I) really came for.. the Hula Pie..  OMG, I cant even explain how good it is, Ice Cream, Cookie, Whipped Topping, Fudge, Mac Nuts.... you should be drooling by now!  (we may have gone back and just sat at the bar on our last night just for Hula Pie)

The so-called ""award winning"" fish tacos are indeed big, but highly Americanized (you know, filled with cheddar cheese, lettuce, and all that unnecessary crap.) The chicken cashew stir-fry is OK, but let me let you in on something: I can cook  ""OK"". I don't come to Maui for ""OK"" -- I come to be wowed.

8/11/2014,4.0 star rating,Went to LeiLani's for my wife's birthday. We were seated pretty fast and the server was quick to get our drinks.  We sat outside and it was a bit windy for that day but was still nice. After we ordered food the server brought out bread to eat. Most of the party ordered some type of fish. I got the Ahi Tuna Steak. This seared dish was seasoned nicely. It came with mixed veggies that complimented the fish nicely. The other fish ordered was also very good. It did seem a bit overpriced for what you got but it is a resort town so you should expect that. Our bill for 4 adults and 2 kids was about $200. The main reason for a 4star and not 5 was when I did the reservation I told them it was my wife's birthday and they said you'll get a free hula pie but when the server came at the end she didn't offer that at first. She kept asking if we wanted anything extra. We all said no because we knew we were getting it. She was about to leave when my wife said I'm feeling a hula pie and then she said oh well you get one free for your birthday. Seemed like she was trying to milk us for something else and then give free pie in addition. I thought she should just say you get a free slice of pie but would anyone else like something additional?  By the way that one piece was enough for all 6 of us!

1/10/2012,2.0 star rating,"After a day of adventures, we went on a hunt for dinner. After seaching through a few reviews, we settled on going to Whaler's Village because they have a decent selection of restaurants there. We saw Leilani's and decided to pop in. There was a 20 minute wait which isn't terrible because there is so much to do there from shopping to walking on the beach. It's also surrounded by a few other restaurants and bars so we didn't mind the wait. Our server was nice and attentive and we were seated outside with a decent view for people watching. The unfortunate thing was that there was nothing really memorable about the food. It was pretty standard fare that I'm sure I could've gotten on the mainland. Being in Maui, I expect to be blown away with native island flavors but I felt that it was a bit waterdown for me to really enjoy the culinary experience. The ambiance was great and the courtyard where we were seated was intimate and allowed for great conversation and memory making.",Shy A.,"Portland, OR",4.0 star rating

Location: Lahaina, HI
Party of: 2
Scene: surfers and shoppers unite! This restaurant is conveniently located off the beach and as a part of Whalers Village. 
Decor: indoor dining room: hawaiian flowers and paintings line the walls, classy, more formal. Outdoor dining room: loud, acoustic music blaring, more casual.
Cuisine: American
Devour: Aloha hour fish tacos and nachos. The fish taco portions are huge, they really should just call it a fish burrito.

They were tasty enough I wouldn't go out of my way to get them again though. The sun was a bit too strong for me on the patio but our waitress kindly pulled down the shades. We finished off with the hula pie which was all right...tasted alot of fudge and vanilla ice cream and macadamia nuts. It was super huge though so don't order more than one.

For all the hotels nearby (we were at the sheraton), there are very few places to eat within walking distance. We had a car but wanted to enjoy a few drinks with dinner. The two main places to choose from in Whaler's village is Leilani's and Hula grill. Hula grill had live music, but Leilani's had better food. This review is for the casual first floor area near the bar, not the sit-down restaurant upstairs. Prices cannot be better for Maui. Entrees range between 10-18 dollars. Everything we tried was delicious. My fiance was a big fan of their chicken green apple and curry salad. I also enjoyed the chicken cashew stirfry, which comes with a tasty side of macaroni salad.

You can order food from the restaurant above if you ask nicely. The crab cakes were great and my mom loved the fish tacos, which they say wins awards there. 
5 nights later we find ourselves here again. Wanting meat I went with the steak with soy sauce and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked I gobbled up everything on my plate. 
With a receipt you can get free dessert. Our first night a local gave us one from his wallet and we had their Hula Pie (ice cream cake) and the 2nd time we had the chocolate cake. Stick with the Hula Pie.

Great location - right on the beach and we had a front table facing the water and got to enjoy the passer-bys as they walked along the beach route.  I tried their famous fish tacos - and they are really good - so recommend them if you are a fish eater - if not they have other ""bar food "" type menu items - burgers and salads, etc.  The fish tacos are in a flour tortilla versus corn - so you might not like that part - but to me, they were really nicely prepared with a lot of things you could throw into the taco (guacamole, salsa, sour cream).  Comes with bagged chips you could probably get at Costco and they probably did, versus more authentic restaurants that serve a fish taco.

We had seats on the balcony, overlooking the ocean, and had a great view of the sunset.

This place does have upstairs seating for steak, seafood, etc., and downstairs seating for sandwiches, burgers, etc.  They have it separated and was a bit confusing at first, but once you decide what you want to eat, it dictates whether you go upstairs or eat downstairs.

Picked something else and I should have spent more time doing so.  When my fish entree came, it was lukewarm and NOT what I was expecting.  My hubby's seared ahi tuna over rice and veggies looked great and was a pretty good sized piece of fish.  My opakapaka was a small piece of fish over shaved celery (which I cannot stand) with a little bit of pineapple and what appeared to be cucumber underneath.  Aside from not tasting all that great, I got to pay $36 for the dish that left me hungry.  Don't get me wrong, I pay a lot of money for fine food and haven't issue but this was a joke.

5/6/2010,5.0 star rating,"My wife and I have been regulars of Leilani's for over 15 years.  We own a condo home next door at The Whaler on Ka'anapali Beach.  Leilani's is tasty food that is fairly priced. Service is prompt and helpful.  Every employee at Leilani's strives to ensure your meal there is special.  Menu can be a bit unadventureous, but the fresh tropical fish specials are extraordinary.  And, one of my late father's expressions:  ""Judge the greatness of a restaurant by it's calamari appetizer-- rarely will they get it right.""  Score for Leilani's:  John L gave it a full ""10"".

Great location for lunch or sunset dining, and Leilani's is family-friendly. Leilani's has a great reputation for it's quality, location and service -- the only drawback -- everybody knows about Leilani's -- crowded every night; summers the dinner wait can be 2 hours if you walk up.  My advice:  eat upstairs (better menu) and make a reservation each time you go.  The view toward the ocean is dead-center on a sunset in paradise.  You really can't go wrong at Leilani's.

Once we were seated, we were taken care of by our very attentive but not obtrusive waiter.  Our meal was fabulous - fresh and well prepared.  My husband had the Grilled Ono with a cilantro-basil sauce, horseradish goat cheese potatoes and pineapple salsa , and I had the Panko-crusted pork chop with tropical chutney and steamed broccoli.

We were told by the front desk person maitre-d that there was some problems in the kitchen and that we should return in 15 minutes (all restaurants have glitches during the course of a meal and that's fine - it's how you handle those problems that really makes an impression). She told all the other guests the same thing. Both my wife and I thought this was a poor choice - we thought it would be much better to seat your guests instead of having them wander around Whaler's Village for 15 minutes. We could tell other guests were very put off. Having said that, the rest of the evening service was exceptional. Our waiter for courteous and very knowledgeable about the items on the menu.

I went here multiple times on my recent trip and had an awesome experience.  

The service is slightly above average as everyone seems to be on island time compared to the SF Bay Area time that I am most accustomed to.

However, the food here is fantastic. 

I went there 3 times for this most recent trip.  

The first time I went there I ordered off their Happy Hour menu and got 2 of their BBQ Pulled-Pork Sliders and a Lava Flow.   So much flavor!

The second time I went there was by far the best.  Theyre is a little blurp message underneath their fish taco item on their menu that says something to the effect of ""Award Winning Fish Tacos""...or something like that.  THEY WERE NOT KIDDING!.  Not sure what kind of fish they use, but they had this cajun spice rub on it that was amazing!..unless of course you do not like spicy food.  My only regret was not ordering this item on my third visit.

The third and final time I went there on my trip, I ordered this Cuban sandwich, which was good, but like most cuban sandwiches had a lot of grease and too much cheese!  You probably think I am crazy in saying there was too much cheese but I try and stay away from it....not because I do not like it but because of personal preference.  (All you cheese haters know what I am talking about)

The fish portions are small and usually come with some small portion of rice & vegetables. We usually go to all the sister restaurants- Leilani's, Hula Grill & Kimo's. We went to Kimo's last night which I thought the fish was prepared better but still a small portion of fish.

10/23/2012,5.0 star rating,"Leilanis has two restaurant venues......we ate at both and had a wonderful time at each one.  This review however refers to the upstairs restaurant and menu.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is just beautiful.....all Koa wood and it looks like the inside of a yacht.  We ate in one of the smaller dining areas on the first floor and it was very cozy and romantic.

The food was simply wonderful.  We both had fish dishes and my Ahi was great.  The entire dinner was just the best we had on our entire trip.

I must add that our waiter James was the best waiter that we've ever had.  Not only did he know everything about the menu, but he was so personable, professional and able to easily converse with all the diners that he made everyone feel at home.

2/9/2011,5.0 star rating,"My review is solely for lunch, happy hour, and late night drinkie drinks.  This review shouldn't be used for dinner or the Sunday service they hold.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, we ""stumbled"" in here  for lunch on our first day in Maui after having spent $20 for basic breakfast at the Sharaton up the beach.  This joint's right on the beach and has a great view of the beach, ocean, and whales in mid-Winter.  Prices looked incredibly cheap here in comparison and they offered a bit more variety than the other restaurants in the area.  So, fish tacos it was for me and Kalua Pork Cuban sandwhich for the Mrs.  I was told the tacos were their specialty.  There are two places in the world I would kill a zombie for the fish tacos and this is one of them.  If you get the Kalua Pork Cuban, ask for the BBQ sauce they use on their wings.  This is a sick, sick, sick combination offered on the second day my wife got the Kalua Pork Cuban sandwhich there, which was actually the third day we stopped in for lunch there.  The Crab and Shrimp melt is also fantastic as is the double kobe burger.  Holy crap the double kobe was yummy.  On my last day in Maui I was torn on whether to get the fish tacos or double kobe, but the fish tacos won out.  Overall, fish tacos three times for me and Kalua Pork Cuban three times for the Mrs.  Yes, we liked them immensely.

Service was good as we always sat at the bar since it was a wait to get a table.  Bartenders were friendly and kept our waters and beers coming.

Happy hour offers four dollar drinkie drinks and a number of $4 sliders along with live music usually from 3 - 5.

10/7/2012,2.0 star rating,"If it weren't for their location, this restaurant wouldn't be in business.  We ate once at the downstairs/casual menu and once with the upstairs/dinner menu.  

Food downstairs was okay.  Downstairs is loud/beachside, but an okay spot to grab a bite to eat.

Food upstairs just wasn't good.  Especially in Maui, where seafood is fresh and should always be sensational, the food just did not taste good.  My husband had the citrus treatment on a white fish, and it was disgusting - we should have sent it back.  It was so overly citrusy, it was barely edible.  I had the parmesan crusted treatment on a white fish and it was just okay.  For the money they charge, you'd think they'd be able to make decent food.

4/3/2015,5.0 star rating,"We were looking for a cheaper dining option without sacrificing the quality of the food last night.  We heard about Leilani's and decided to try out the beachside grill (make sure it's the beachside grill area if you want more reasonable prices).  After a 2 HOUR wait, our party of 7 was finally seated.  Although it wasn't quite worth that long of a wait, it came pretty darn close.  The setting was literally beachside and was the perfect place to watch the sunset.  The food was also exquisite.  Our whole party either ordered the famous fish tacos (by far the best fish tacos I've ever had in Maui) or the fresh Hawaiian catch.  After dinner, we had to try the renowned hula pie, and it didn't disappoint.  FYI, the hula pie is huge and could easily feed anywhere from 2-4 people.  My only gripes would be the LONG wait and our waiter.  He had a bit of an attitude and didn't return once to refill our waters.  Besides that, Leilani's is a great restaurant for a reasonable price.

3/19/2015,1.0 star rating,"Went there to celebrate a 25th Anniversary.  Had a 7:30 reservation with a request to sit in the upstairs dining room.  Arrived early and was told we would be seated early.  After watching several parties be seated in the upstairs dining room, we were seated 15 minutes late in an outside patio that looks like it is a reclaimed ally.  After we refused to sit there, we were taken back to the host stand and the manager proceeded to be ""nicely"" condescending when he explained how they never ""promise"" specific seating, but if we waited another unspecified period of time, he would see what he could do.  That was enough for us and we left.  This restaurant is clearly successful and they probably don't care about me (you) as a customer, as they have all they can handle.  It is all about the location, view, and processing people for payment.  The unfortunate thing for me is that I have always enjoyed and for many years frequented their other restaurants both in Hawaii and California.  That is a practice that I will no longer continue.

Had the crab cake for appetizer but only liked the salsa that comes with it. Then comes the steak n coconut shrimp.. The shrimp was good. But the steak smell ""beefy"".

3/6/2011,2.0 star rating,"My fam has been coming to Ka'anapali since I was in junior high, and it may just be that my standards have increased since I was 14, but I swear this place has gone significantly downhill over the years. This year was the first that I remember really being disappointed. I feel like the beach grill menu used to feature a lot more in the way of local produce and fish, but there is hardly a Maui onion to be seen on the menu these days. My $15 grilled mahi sandwich featured a fish portion about a third the size of the bun it was served on (though, to be fair, the jerk seasoning and execution of said tiny portion was decent). My hub's kalua pork sandwich was somewhat better, and my mom liked her salad with ahi tuna, but all in all it was pretty unremarkable, and you could certainly find food of better quality for less money at any number of local food joints, like Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina. I guess you pay for the convenience of being stumbling distance from the beachfront hotels of Ka'anapali and the ability to whale watch or enjoy the sunset over Lanai from your table. The Hula Pie is okay, and as others have noted, the portion is gigantic, but the ice cream tastes a little cheap-- if you're getting it as a free bonus, as we do with our Marriott timeshare stay, stick mostly with the mac nut chocolate topping and the chocolate crust for the most satisfying experience. 

There is often a substantial wait here (giving you opportunity to explore Whaler's Villages and buy the Louis Vuitton bag of your dreams while you wait! ... or not), and I am not at all convinced that it's worth it. Take it from me and consider the below-average quality for above-average prices an incentive to branch out and explore the many superior offerings that are available only a short drive away.",Elisa S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0 star rating

Happy hour is located here, and play live music during those times. Upstairs,(entrance is located on other side as if you were entering whalers village), also has great views and food like steak and of course the fish options. I recommend the ono fish(bread crusted of course) with lemon capper sauce. Yum! And I absolutely LOVE the caprese salad with the golden beets, tomatoes, and fresh soft mozzarella, drizzled in white balsamic dressing that just melts in you mouth! I often crave this salad back home in California!

The pros: Beautiful setting, great service....our server was Lance :)

The cons: The food was bland, dry, just not very appetizing for the price.  The decor is outdated......it probably hasn't been updated in 20 years.  The restaurant was comparable to Red Lobster on the beach.

I had two mai tai's and the hubs had the beer.  We looked at their dinner menu and saw they had ono fish tacos so decided we would come back for dinner at sunset.  We paid our bill and saw on the bottom of the receipt that our next visit to Leilanis we got a free hula pie or zucchini sticks! Which was perfect because we returned 2 hours later for dinner! We were hungry so we got the house salad and the ono tacos....both amazing! We topped it off with our free hula pie and were stuffed!

10/7/2008,2.0 star rating,"Normally I don't like giving a poor review due to poor service because I figure that, in all likelihood, a restaurant doesn't want it's wait staff to be complete fucking idiots and I prefer to base my rating on what the establishment has to offer.  Besides, who among us hasn't shown up to work on occassion with a hangover, bad attitude, or general lack of desire to be at work that day.  Christ, you could say that I'm in that situation right now, I'm at work and not doing my job, but I work in accounting and there aren't people downstairs waiting for me to bring them food.

But I digress... My family was staying at the Whaler which is a stones throw from this place and were at Leilani's about a week ago.  Upon being seated, my dad commented to the hostess that our candle wasn't lit, and she replied with ""oh your waiter can take care of that.""  For the next 30 minutes the only contact the staff had with our party was when they slammed into my chair while walking by.  

To make a long story short, our waiter sucked ass.  He was unaware that we were his customers and upon learning this from a waitress we managed to flag down he did a few laps around the joint before coming over.  When he finally came over, he informed us that he had been in the bathroom... not really what you want to hear from your waiter.  Wait-staff and hot chicks, two groups who I never want to hear from about taking a dump.

Anyhow, the guy got his shit together pretty quickly after the horrendous start, and I don't even remember what I ordered.  The food was nothing special and I can't really comment on much else because all I remember is that our waiter was a moron.  

If you are in the area you'll probably say ""fuck it"" and eat here because you are hungry and the wait at the hula grill is twice as long.  Hell, I'll probably go back because I have no fear that this guy has already been fired or quit because of a lack of tips, so the service will likely be better.",Jeff C.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating
12/5/2008,2.0 star rating,"The location is amazing but honestly the food is bad. I like the Hula Pie but thats about it.

If you are going to spend money on food like this you would be better to go to KIMO's which also had a pretty view and better (though not great) food.

The burgers are blah, I mean common who cannot make a burger? The servers are kind of slow and I think that many of the guys come here to oogle them in their small dresses.

2/27/2012,2.0 star rating,"So this is our fourth or fifth time to west Maui and each time we have eaten here, usually a couple of time each trip, and like our experience at the Sheareton Maui, it has gone down hill every time to the point we will not return. 

It's part of a large chain, and really starting to feel that way, and for you Hula Grill lovers watch out, as they own that too.  We haven't been there yet this trip but I digress. 

Once past the wow factor of THEE PERFECT LOCATION  for a restaurant , the machine that is Leilani's becomes more and more apparent. The sea of humanity that is the boardwalk at dinner in front of Leilani's and Hula Grill, almost begs for the cattle like approach taken to greet, seat, and wait on you. 

The food has gone from fantastic (now I am wondering if I too had succumbed to the beauty of the location, and great-fullness of getting a table and having a waiter acknowledge us in years past and not been objective the last few trips) to marginal. 

Maybe my expectations for a hundred dollar meal has risen in my old age, or maybe Leilani's has become what all great restaurants become, a machine to generate cash flow, cutting all possible corners and depending on the churn of different tourists on vacation who will never return or write a review to sustain them. 

If you have never been, you should go, have the fish, maybe you actually get some sauce, maybe it's good, and you too will rant great things.  If you are returning and have other options, I would take them.",Sam I.,"Jamul, CA",4.0 star rating

The waiter was terrific!  We ate upstairs from the dinner menu (there's an upstairs and a downstairs, with downstairs having more of a bar menu). Our waiter greeted us right away and gave us piping hot bread and took our drink orders right away.  I had the ""Coconut Grove"" which was great.  We ordered salads and they were fantastic.  I had the caprese salad which was a taste sensation and my boyfriend had spinach with egg salad that he thoroughly enjoyed.  For my entree I had monchung (kind of like opakapaka fish) that was pistachio crusted over a risotto cake. OMG is all I can say. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  My boyfriend had blackened mahi mahi with shrimp over rice with polenta and veggies and he loved it.  For dessert we ordered the famous ""Hula Pie"". It lived up to every expectation.  It was gigantic and our waiter recommended us ordering only 1 to share. I hate to share my dessert because I love it so much, but I went with his recommendation. He was right!  I never saw such a huge piece of pie for less than $7, especially in Maui where everything is so expensive.  We gave our waiter a little extra because he was excellent.

I must say their fish & chips is among my favorite on the island, thn when you cut through the island aura, the restaurant just feels chain-ish. My wife ordered the fish & chips because she loves the fish. She avoids potatoes, rice, pasta, etc. so asked if there was a substitute available. All they could offer were the things she was avoiding. She suggested the small handful of tortilla chips & tiny cup of salsa. No way, can't do it. The manager came to our table w/ a big island smile & after greeting us went on to explain how important portion control is in today's economy. Really? Well, you can have your portion control & we'll stick w/ smaller local restaurants.
We've tried it two times this trip, both times found the help friendly enough, but not at all attentive. Had to ask for silverware both times & remind them about a refill for our ice tea. They were very friendly when delivering the tab & wishing us a great day, but by then it was too late to earn a 20% tip.
The 2 stars are just for the location, fish & chips & oh yeah, despite other reviewers dissing it, don't skip the hula pie dessert. Yep, just ice cream between chocolate stuff above & below, but tasty & fun to share w/ your table guests. Aloha",Steve M.,"Colbert, WA",4.0 star rating

The food here wasn't good. We had the slider burgers (3 small burgers) and the ahi grilled sandwich. Both were full of filler, and unappealing spices. The ahi sandwich was like ordering a crab-cake sandwich. Neither of us finished our meal - the fries were fine, and about all we ate. Leilani's has that chain feel to it. 

If you want a good meal, skip Leilani's and go across the way to Hula Grill. It was outstanding, with very fresh food, great drinks, live music and awesome service.",P J.,"Fremont, CA",4.0 star rating

1/12/2015,1.0 star rating,We have gone to this restaurant for years but last night was the worst ever. We will never return. The waiter was inexperienced and brought my husband an appetizer for his main entree and then argued with him about it. The manager then brought the same thing back to him and in a condescending way tried to get him to accept this dinner. We go to this place frequently and own next door!  He then agreed to bring him what he ordered. It was the same shrimp on a different plate with some vegetables and the same French fries.  They charged us half for his dinner. It should have been free after all the screw ups. It was our anniversary so we were to get a Hula pie but the waiter comes up and says due to our problems he will buy a Hula Pie on him. What an idiot. There were multiple open tables which should have told us something because they always were packed and Hula Grill had a huge waiting line. What a disappointment!,Nama C.,"San Clemente, CA",4.0 star rating
1/7/2009,5.0 star rating,"So I don't know about the other reviewers, but I ate upstairs in the more formal dining part and everything was great.  I came here with my extended family and everyone found something delicious to order.  The ribs were fantastic and so was the monchong special I ordered.  My aunty got the shrimp scampi pasta and that was the first time I've seen her clean her plate.  

Everyone says the service is bad, but our waiter was awesome.  He filled all our water glasses and didn't waste time getting our food out.  He was happy to take our pictures and he even gave us two free Hula Pies, one of my favourite desserts on the island.  The view from Leilani's is outstanding and the atmosphere is hard to beat.  I like the Hula Grill too, but here it wasn't as crowded and noisey.  In my opinion I our waiter was better than the waiters usually are at Hula Grill, you also don't have the whole hour-long wait for a seat.

Definitely a spot to hit up if you're in the area and add your own review.  Also as a side note, Leilani's, Kimo's, and Hula Grill are all owned by the same parent company, TS Restaurants.",Garrett W.,"New York, NY",4.0 star rating

11/2/2008,2.0 star rating,"The best thing about this place is its location.  It's at the end of Whaler's Village right off the ocean with beautiful views.  Unfortunately, that's about all I can say positive about this (except the hula pie, which is based off the one from Kimo's, their sister restaurant).  

Our server was rather inattentive, and it took 3+ requests before she refilled our water glasses.  (We were sitting next to the bar, so I literally could see her leave our table after our desperate requests for water, which she acquiesced to, meander to the bar, look around, fiddle at the register, walk to her other tables, etc.  She literally forgot the water multiple times within 1 second of leaving our table!)  

The food wasn't too bad.  The lemonade was too overly sweet/syrupy.  I'm sorry to have to dock a place for its service, but after an entire vacation of wonderful food & service, having Leilani's as our last meal made it a rather underwhelming end to our trip.",Grace C.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4.0 star rating
1/20/2009,3.0 star rating,"We ate lunch at the downstairs casual part. Nice view of the beach and Molokai. The food was pretty decent. Definitely try the queso chips, and fries. My Mai Tai was also to die for.

The service was awful. I am so sorry that I cannot remember our horrible server's name in this online public sphere. (Was it Shannon? Sharon? Nicole?) She took forever checking in with us. Then she got in an argument with me about a menu item that reads ""Buffalo Wings"" but says in the description that it is ""in a Barbeque sauce"". When I was trying to see if I had a choice between the two she basically insinuated that I am stupid because I can't read the menu descriptions. Okay, I know Chicago is a ways away from Hawaii, but they seemed to understand the difference between barbeque and buffalo sauces just fine on the other side of the island. Oh and maybe I would remember the server's name if she ever brought us the right check! This also didn't happen.

We were seated upstairs as far back in the restaurant as you can go, and the food wasn't that amazing so I would hold out for a better table if I came back. Seems to be a big crowd for dinner so reservations are a must. 

The fish dishes weren't bad. I had the blackened ahi tuna with sweet chili pepper sauce and island fruit salsa and it had a nice kick.  They serve it with a rice side that struck me as old fashioned, like the recipe came from a Betty Crocker cookbook circa 1972. 

What I did love, though, was ""Leilani's Potatoes"" (recommended by our waiter)---au gratin potatoes with goat cheese and a bit of horseradish. Yum! We ordered it as a side for the table and it was gone in seconds.",Becky S.,"North Hollywood, CA",4.0 star rating

It just tasted bad and not fresh.  The waitress noticed and the manager came out and assured me it was not frozen and kindly offered me something else.  I didn't really want anything else so she comped it.  My friend got the tacos and she thought they were ok.

2/27/2012,2.0 star rating,"Perhaps it is never good to start a review on an empty stomach, but when you have a reservation, who's time is more valuable? Obviously in this case, it's Leilani's.

Finally 25 minutes after a mutually agreed upon reservation time, we get a table. I can see numerous empty 2 and 4 top tables, so I wouldn't call this a busy night. 

10 minutes later we are acknowledge by the waiter, and instead of asking what we'd like to drink, our waiter starts in on the catch of the day.

Our appetizer, the shrimp and scallops with a sweet chili sauce, was delicious and cooked perfectly. My husband and I both ordered the same entree, the parmesan encrusted manchong (deep sea mild white fish) with lemon caper sauce. While both were good, there was no consistency in the plating. One dish had noticeably more sauce, larger piece of fish and the coating was a deeper brown. It was necessary to ask for more sauce for the second dish. 

At these kind of prices, the bar is set higher. While the food itself is good, I feel Leilani's is not ready for the high jump.",Ashley I.,"San Diego, CA",4.0 star rating

I ended up with a salad that was, well, just lettuce. Lettuce is not dinner. And the dressing wasn't very good, either. 

My parents assured me that at least the dessert would be fantastic -- their ""Kimo's famous hula pie -- what the sailors swam to shore for"" would surely be fantastic, wouldn't it?  It was frozen solid and never reached that in-between soft stage when ice cream is oh-so-good. No, it just went from frozen solid to runny liquid.

9/3/2010,2.0 star rating,"Very unimpressed. Maybe it was the wind or maybe the bad food but I walked away definitely not feeling any aloha. The location was great with an ocean view and being in the posh Whaler's Village but I really had an unenjoyable experience.
The appetizer was a joke. Four coconut prawns for $9? Really? The prawns were over-cooked and had no coconut flavor. It was also really tough to eat without having any utensils or napkins... The only ray of hope was the pre-packaged sauce served with the prawns that masked the lack of flavor.
The burgers, the highlight of the menu, continued the theatrical mockery of the a real menu. I ordered the Double Kobe Burger and what i received was a notch above a McDonalds double cheeseburger. The patties were tiny, overcooked, and seriously lacking flavor. I asked for medium rare and there was no red at all in the pattie. The only kobe-esque factor was the tenderness in the patties; they were very tender but then so is a McDonalds cheesburger. The only condiment was a mixture of cheddar and (mozzarella?) cheese on top of the burger with carmelized hawaiian red onions. This added some good flavor on top of an otherwise flavorless set of patties. The bun culminated the McDonalds feels; it was tiny, wrinkled, and really cheapened the whole Kobe experience. This was much more of a Bobby Hurley burger than a Kobe burger (disclaimer: Kobe refers to a city in Japan that farms cows that produce amazingly flavorful and tender beef; not Mr. Bryant). 

I wish I would have gone to the Hula Grill next door instead of trying to save a few bucks at Leilani's. In fact, I wish I would have gone to Mcdonalds to pay 1/5 of the price for a similar product!",Nick C.,"Sacramento, CA",4.0 star rating

I decided to try them out and I am so glad that I did because they were fantastic. The tacos were soft shell, had a nice bit of pico, some southwestern sauce and cheese.

but the food was worth the wait with a great view!

my family and i had the dining room menu and not the more casual ""lunch"" menu.

Appetizers:
-sourdough bread and butter. fantastic free starter. the sourdough was baked in small loafs so the taste was spread evenly and the butter was very good. not sure if many places offer sourdough.
-fish chowder was absolutely amazing. there is nothing wrong with it. a must get
-shrimp and scallops had a tasty sauce, but a little to fancy for my taste for the price and only two pieces of each. the shrimp was a a tad overcooked.

Entrees:
we had all four fish items on the menu
-Sesame crusted ahi was satisfying.  i had it rare but i wish i had it medium rare. i like seared ahi, but the sesame seeds made it annoying to eat. still a great dish though
-pistachio fish was in my opinion the worst fish item. just bland.
-fish and shrimp. the tomatoes based sauce iwas good, but hte highlight of the dish was definitely the shrimp.  the big, plump shrimp was cooked to perfection.  my cousin ate it all up.
-the last fish item which the name eludes us, was very good.

Dessert:
Hula pie was above and beyond! i loved it and i am not a fan of pie.  not sure if the is considered pie though since the filling is ice cream.  the crust was soo good. it was two layers of the oreo crust with caramel in middle. i could eat it every day.

Leilani's was definitely good and cheaper than the neighboring hula grill. i have a review of hula grill also.",Jonathan N.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4.0 star rating

8/21/2013,4.0 star rating,"Went to Leilani's On The Beach during a recent trip to Maui and found it to be one of the better restaurants on the west side. The view from the decks looking out over the ocean is terrific, particularly at sunset when we were there. Overall the ambience is pretty good, not overly loud in spite of being very busy. Generally speaking the entire Whaler's Village area has managed to mute the feeling of tourist trap and if you're going to get out of paying for parking there, eating at Leilani's and getting validated is a great way of doing it.

Now with respect to the food! We split both a salad and a braised pork plate as a starter. The salad was good, if somewhat unremarkable. The braised pork, on the other hand, was tremendous; it melts in your mouth and the sauce is wonderfully balanced. For mains, I had the ahi which the waitress described as spicy and it certainly was, perhaps a little too much so. While the quality of fish was exemplary and the spiciness was not completely over the top, it was a little strong for how understated fresh ahi can be and the fish became merely a vehicle for the spice. My wife had some chicken, in spite of my recommendation that chicken sounded a little on the bland side for such a tropical place; boy was I wrong. The chicken was really tasty, juicy, and the sauce on it was fantastic. If you have any qualms about ordering chicken, you can definitely set them aside for this. As far as dessert goes, the Hula Pie was large and filled with ice cream, but a little but of a letdown given the hype. Definitely nothing wrong with it, and it for sure feels fit for two, but it doesn't feel quite distinct enough to be worth the praise.

Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to eat in west Maui you would be well served to check out Leilani's.",Josh H.,"Union City, CA",4.0 star rating
5/19/2012,2.0 star rating,"We went here the last time we were on Maui and the steak was awesome.  After the bad experience at Kimo's with them butterflying my steak and turning it into jerky, I wanted to make sure this restaurant (owned by the same company) didn't do the same.  I asked our server C. (when he finally bothered showing up) if they butterflied steak and he said no he'd never seen that but did I want it that way and I said no, absolutely not and he agreed it would be silly to do that to a perfectly good steak.  I hoped that this meal was going to be better even though service wise it was not off to a great start.  I'll be damned if they didn't come out with a paper thin steak.  When C. finally made his way back over he said he couldn't believe they did that and did I want them to cook me another one.  I told him no because we didn't have time to wait around but thanks anyway and it was fine.  Well, 5 bites in and I just couldn't finish it.  Between that and the cold potatoes (for both of us), I wasn't going to eat any more.  Thank God I filled up on bread.  The hubby told him it turned out I wasn't going to eat it so could it be taken off the bill since I'd specifically said I didn't want it that way.  He was very apologetic and said he could bring something else out or comp a dessert too and we said no but thanks anyway.  It was our last night on Maui and we just wanted to get back to the condo and pack.  Then the manager comes out and is apologizing and I'm glad they want their customers happy but it was a little drawn out so it ended up making me look like one of those trouble makers that is never happy with their meals.  I NEVER send anything back or complain but the hubs said there was no way we were paying $25 for a meal I had 5 bites of so this time we were saying something.  I wish I could say mine was the only bad experience but the manager had to apologize to two other tables that night so obviously something is awry at Leilani's.  Disappointing.",A.

5/20/2010,2.0 star rating,"The only appeal is the ambiance as it is quite literally on the beach. Here's what I had:

+ Shrimp appetizer: $11 with cold shrimp, dipping sauce, and absolutely nothing else. It's good - for a shrimp cocktail.

- Grilled fish sandwich with salsa: It was bland and so not the business. DRY too.

- Grilled fish salad: It's literally a green salad with a small fish steak plopped on top. I could make this myself for half the price.

+ Fish n chips: dry fish, but I did enjoy it! It wasn't gross and greasy like most battered foods. It was more of a panko type coating with a delicious and chunky tartar sauce. 

+ Hula Pie: YES. It's gigantic. You can definitely split it, and it came free with a Marriott promotion. The chocolate top is a bit thick - perfect for chocolate lovers which I am not. The macadamia nut ice cream is wonderful, and the Oreo cookie crust on the bottom is worth it all.

11/16/2011,2.0 star rating,"While on our honeymoon in Maui we ventured over to Whaler's Village and decided to eat dinner at Leilani's. They have two sections the dining room which steak and seafood menu and the beachside grill with burgers and sandwiches, etc. Since I was in the mood for lobster we opted for the dining room. BIG MISTAKE. Maybe we would have enjoyed the beachside grill menu more I don't know. After waiting about 45 minutes we get seated at our table. We ordered our drinks and I got a virgin pina colada since I don't drink and my husband got a jack and coke. It is kind of hard to screw up a pina colada but they managed to. It tasted so awkward it is hard to describe. My husbands jack and coke was way to strong!! It smelled like lighter fluid. He had to ask for a plain coke so he could mix it better. I ordered the lobster tail and all I can say is ewwwwwwwww. It was just bad, the lobster was so tough I could barely chew it and it had no flavor whatsoever. The rice that came with dish was also tasteless and undercooked. I did not enjoy any of my meal. My husband ordered the prime rib and thank God it was huge or I would have starved. It was very good and we both enjoyed it. His mashed potatoes were nasty though. The service was just ok nothing special. Honestly I would not recommend the dining room.

All we wanted was a hamburger bun with baby spinach, cucumbers, tomato, and onion on it but they were unable to accomodate us. I found it to be somewhat callous since all the items requested were being served in one way or another.

5/28/2007,5.0 star rating,"Driving up to Whalers Village, we were on diets.

Walking into Leilani's, we were still on diets.

Sitting down at our table, we bemoaned eating too much, fearing that a big dinner coupled with the next night's luau buffet would be far too much.

Looking at the menu, my brother and I followed our alleged diets by deciding to share a dinner entree (mahi mahi) and a salad (islander's).

Ordering our food, we caved into family pressure to eat more and added crab cakes to our shared plates (this we did not regret).

This. place. was. so. damn. good.

And good value, too!  For the attention to detail, quality of ingredients, and service, I and my family were extremely pleased with the dinner.  Plus the view of the sunset over the neighboring islands was killer.  

I highly recommend the following (after sampling everyone's food)
- blackened seared ahi tuna - amazingly tender texture, and I don't even like partially raw (or fully raw) fish!  comes with some great island fruit salsa.
- crab cakes - I love crab cakes and these were some of the best I've ever had. It tasted like real crab with real flavor, not like breaded crab bits molded into hockey puck form.
- any salad with papaya dressing
- fish chowder...it left me speechless.
- the sourdough bread comes piping hot and it's freakin delicious.  our first batch was a little overbaked, but the next one was perfect.
- hula pie dessert...amazing chocolate cookie thing on the bottom, great chocolate sauce, and yummy macadamia nut texture that really adds to the cake.  Keep in mind I am not a chocolate lover.

We were sooooo [happily] full.  Screw dieting.

The fish was cooked just right and the salsa provided just the right amount of sweet and salt to the fish.  We also got the Hula Pie for desert and it was great.  It's a macadamia nut ice cream pie with an oreo cookie crust with fudge on top.  It should definitely be shared.

So we paid and got another ""coupon"" on our receipt (they do this always), I said too bad we won't be here to use it since we are leaving. The waiter told us to save it.

For dinner we split the shrimp scampi and the local fresh catch which was Mon Chung. The Scampi was good with large shrimp and kitchen even split it into 2 plates for us. It wasn't the best Scampi I've ever had but it was good and the fresh grated cheese on top was a nice touch. The Mon Chung, done in lemon and caper sauce , was amazing.

The ice cream is super tall though, so it makes for one gigantic piece.

I think it'd be better with a little less ice cream (not so tall) and if it was macadamia nut ice cream or coffee ice cream. But still, it was good and one slice fed 3 of us.

6/22/2011,4.0 star rating,We always try and come here for dinner when we are in Maui.  Great atmosphere and the food is always good and it didn't disappoint.  I made reservations which I highly recommend and we ended up waiting a little longer for an upstairs outside ocean table which we didn't mind.  Service was good so no complaints there.  Our group really enjoyed the chowder and ahi tuna tower as a starters and for dinner if they have the monchong fish special definitely get it.  The teriyaki steak was good; the short ribs were a little overcooked by with the sauce and gorgonzola potatoes still tasted good.  The ribs were good but could have a little more meat on them.  If you are staying at the Marriott (other hotels may do this as well) you can show your discount card for a free hula pie which is delicious.  It's a little different than Dukes but still really good.  Also the apple crisp was yummy as well if you don't want the hula pie....which by the way is definitely big enough to share!  We will definitely return hopefully sooner rather than later. :),Erin K.,"Dublin, OH",4.0 star rating

After sitting at the bar for 20 minutes... we were having such a great time that we decided to just eat at the bar.  Ordered the double Kobe cheese burger and Kalua Pork Cuban. The burger was like a Double\Double from In N Out... except better. The Cuban was an awesome sammie that was filled with tender pork, pepper jack and pickles. Both came with fries that were over salted but tasty.

We stayed at the bar for over 3 hours and chatted with both locals and tourists. The bartenders (especially Steveo) were the best we had during our vacation and even they bought us a round of drinks on the house. Perfect Mai Tais, cold local beers, friendly bartenders and a sunset view of Ka'anapali beach... what more could you ask for?

Great service, view, and food. Excellent local Hawaiian fish catch. We ate at both the dining room and the beach bar and both were excellent.  It was so good that it blew away last year's poor review. Loved Leilani's!

I had the chicken here and wish that I would have had the fish! I had the tropical curried chicken salad at the beach bar and it was great.

FIRST REVIEW MARCH 2007 - 3 stars

My husband and I went to the Leilani's Grill, not the dining room.

We were seated and waited 20 minutes for drinks. Once we ordered, the food was not that great. We think it had been sitting around for a while.

The view was not wonderful because it was obstructed by the bushes, but you are still on Kaanapali beach. Still, I would go over to the Hula Grill instead on the other side of the Whaler's Village.",Kristen C.,"Chicago, IL",4.0 star rating

11/6/2007,4.0 star rating,"Leilani's is a GREAT place to have lunch or a light dinner.  Food is always consistent. 3 words: Island Fish Tacos! 3 more words: Location, Location, Location! Views are wonderful - what's NOT TO LOVE? I mean you're in frickin Maui, on Kaanapali Beach!?! 

We have been recommending Leilani's to friends and they all agree it's a great place to grab a bite and take in the views! 

Why is this not a 5 star review? Well, we just ate at Leilani's early October 2007 & T's Restaurants went el cheapo on the HULA PIE. They went with a lower quality ice cream and changed forever what was great about one of our favorite Island desserts; Hula Pie. It's simply not acceptable.

I give the restaurant 3 stars because the dining area seemed kinda dirty. Carpet was very dingy and needs to be replaced. Had that nasty carpet smell throughout the restaurant.

When our waiter passed our table I asked him....where is our wine?   He snarled ""it's coming"".    I ordered the citrus fired fresh fish but by the time it arrived my husband was so angry that although it was very good I hurried to eat so we could just leave.    I think they were short staffed but hey that is not an excuse to be rude to the customers.    We will never go back as there are plenty of restaurants that are more pleasant.

He informed us that they had just seated a big party of 15, and asked if we would like to get our order in before they did! YES! We all put our orders in, and the food came out pretty quickly. We had some delicious appetizers - the scallops, crab cakes, and ahi tuna tower - all delicious. For my main, I ordered the steak filet with lobster - it was amazing. The steak was cooked perfectly medium, and it was accompanied by a thick piece of lobster, that tasted amazing. I did not even use the butter that they provided with the lobster. The serving size was very large - I only ate about half of my meal, and then shared the leftovers with my dad and brother. The restaurant was family friendly - we had our 9 month old with us, and there was even room next to our table to park our big BOB stroller.

The bar and entire downstairs area is under construction--not just closed off, but ACTIVELY under construction!  So after waiting for a table (with pager) for 20 minutes, we were seated and ordered drinks. After a few minutes and a few sips of our drinks we got used to the hammering and table saw noises from downstairs. But then, after we ordered and before our food was served, the REAL racket began. It sounded like a small jackhammer or possibly a hammersaw of some sort, truly made all the restaurant patrons look around, at each other, shrugging, how can this be? We're trying to have a nice lunchtime experience, but NO.  We asked to see a manager, but no manager appeared.  Were there any explanations when we asked for a table?  For example, it might be noisy due to construction? No.  The hostess explained, as we walked away, they have to make the noise during the day so they don't upset the hotel folks at night. Right.

It was a party of four this run, the 'ole lady, and my folks.

Let me start by saying that I'm not much of the seafood type,  however....

When in Rome!   You have to! Right?

I opted for the MacadamiaNut MahiMahi select....  Our waiter was a nice younger gentleman but definitely was a ""know it all"".  My first pick was the short ribs but assured me that the Mahi was the better of the two options considering my mainland experience with beef and the sort.

This is a place not to miss with the sunet however if you aren't a fish guy, I'd recommend something different from my selection.

I'm gonna give this 3.5 stars, for a great view and delicious Hawaiian beers....

EDIT:

So I went back there last night and met a few friends, this run I sat downstairs as were there primarily for a few drinks.

The sashimi was so fresh that I would've believed them if they had told me that they just caught the fish 5 minutes ago.  The garnish that came with it was also delicious--pickled daikon and cucumber.  My favorite was the hula pie that we ordered for dessert.  I was expecting something small, similar to a slice of an apple pie.  Instead, we got this huge mound of macadamia vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, chocolate cookie crust and whipped cream.  It was pure deliciousness.  The restaurant is kid friendly with lots of high chairs and they give out crayons with a coloring sheet of paper to kids.

5/1/2008,3.0 star rating,"Ahh Leilani's..not sure what to say about this place, so I'll just start from the beginning.

We had reservations upstairs for 6pm..arrived at 5:30 & went to the hostess counter just to let them know we were there (we anticipated waiting at the bar until 6)..but they had a table ready for us, so we were seated early. Nice!

Our waiter Anthony was very pleasant & took care of our drinks promptly; my fiance ordered a lava flow & I had a mango colada, both of which were VERY tasty. Next up were the appetizers; we ordered sashimi and crab cakes, and while they were separate appetizers, the flavors complimented each other nicely.

On to dinner. My fiance ordered seared blackened ahi, and I ordered the special surf & turf (petit filet mignon and 2 tiger prawns). Both plates looked wonderful when they arrived, but disaster soon struck. I cut into my filet, which I had ordered medium well, and much to my dismay, it was freaking raw. My fiance got Anthony's attention & asked him to bring it back; he quickly grabbed a small plate to put the filet on so that I could continue eating the prawns in the meantime. I must say, the prawns were huge and very delicious, if not a hair on the dry side. Sadly, I was just about done with my prawns when my filet reappeared. And guess what!? It was STILL freaking RAW. In their defense, it was no longer mooing, but the inside was still far too reminiscent of an open wound for me to want anything to do with it. Luckily for me (or is it luckily for him?), my fiance likes his meat raw, so he ate the offending hunk of dead cow with much gusto.

You'd think that would be the worst of it. But no! Anthony wasn't done with us yet. We finished our meal & paid for it, and had left the building when our pal Anthony came running after us claiming that he'd charged us for the wrong table & needed to run the credit card again. Now who enjoys having their credit card billed over and over? No one. Thankfully, Anthony was quick about it, and did provide us with a voided receipt for the first bill. But to add insult to injury, the second bill was even higher than the first. Ugh.

Their fish just comes with rice pilaf, which ordinarily I think is the lamest of sides, but theirs was well done.  Also ordered a side of asparagus with hollandaise which was perfectly cooked.  Since we didn't have room for their famed Hula pie we went back another night and it did not disappoint!

11/28/2007,5.0 star rating,"Had thanksgiving dinner here with the fam last week. Great service and delicious food (with the exception of the fish chowder, which tasted like a bowl of creamy nothing). My dad's steak was terribly well done so the manager came back with a filet for him instead - certainly didn't have to upgrade the cut but that's what makes this restaurant shine. That and the gorgeous sunset views.",Erica Jade L.,"New York, NY",4.0 star rating
4/19/2009,3.0 star rating,"The grilled fish sandwich with pineapple salsa was great. The fish & chips used a fillet cut, instead of the more normal cut, but it tasted good. The hula pie, was delicious, and not frozen solid, as I've had at other Duke's restaurants.",Tim K.,"Moreno Valley, CA",4.0 star rating
4/4/2011,5.0 star rating,"The hostesses are very professional and extremely welcoming. I recommend dinning upstairs so you can enjoy the romantic sunset. Excellent wine selection. The prime rib and fresh catch of the day is always delicious. For an appetizer order the crab cakes, they are phenomenal! We have been to Leilani's several times and we're always satisfied with the food and service.",Mrs. A.,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",4.0 star rating
5/28/2007,4.0 star rating,"Similar to the Hula Grill, also in Whaler's Village, you have the choice of formal dining upstairs and inside or casual dining outside and near the beach.  I recommend the casual dining.  You don't visit Maui (especially from San Francisco) to eat inside.  I was craving some fish and chips and had passed over them on several menus throughout my vacation.  I finally tried them at Leilani's and was a bit disappointed.  They were made from Ono and sorta chewy.  I'm thinking me no likey the Ono for fish and chips.   Try something else, mmkay?  Sounds like the fish tacos are better.",Derek B.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
9/25/2007,3.0 star rating,"I like Leilani's because their food is always pretty good, you get a salad included in the price of the meal and the view is great, but they really need to change up their menu - I think they've had the same stuff on there for at least a decade. Service is strange, although it makes for interesting dinner conversation - by this I mean that all the waiters seem like they've been taking advantage of the local plant life ;)",Lindsey S.,"New York, NY",4.0 star rating
3/3/2011,4.0 star rating,"Beautiful! The view was spectacular and ALL the food was beyond belief! I love Ahi and sushi, but this was the best I had the whole week on Maui! It was a little difficult to find (being in the back of an outdoor shopping complex), and the service was a little slow, but then again, we had a wedding party of about 20. The Hula Pie was decadent!",Rebecca M.,"Everett, WA",4.0 star rating
11/1/2010,4.0 star rating,"Decent seafood, good service, nice location.. What more does one want? Yes it's a bit pricey but what isn't in Maui? This place definitely deserves a visit if you're around Lahaina, but probably not worth driving more than 10 minutes for it.",Giray S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0 star rating
10/7/2010,5.0 star rating,"Loved, loved, LOVED the grilled fish and Kahula pork tacos for $4 each during happy hour on Tuesdays (wished it were available all the time!).  There was also a band during happy hour playing at their outdoor seating area overlooking the ocean...life just doesn't get much better than that!",J. M.,"Boston, MA",4.0 star rating
1/2/2010,4.0 star rating,Better than the Hula grill which is across the walkway (and also owned by the same company as well as Kimo's). Food was pretty good and service wasn't bad either. The bar staff was fun and the drinks were good.,Albert R.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating
5/28/2010,4.0 star rating,"We ate here lots! I think mostly I kept coming back for the Fish Tacos. Don't bother with any of the salads though, they are kind of a waste here unfortunately. We got hula pie (i forget how, i think i had a coupon...check all the guide books or ask your westin concierge) for free, which is just something you HAVE to do while in maui!  if you keep your receipt (just like at Hula Grill), you get another free hula pie on your next visit (or zuchini sticks...which were also really good come ot think of it!). Loved this place ...esp when the sun was setting (it's an outdoor restaurant mainly)",P T.,"Bellevue, WA",4.0 star rating
9/6/2010,4.0 star rating,"It is in a terrific location in Whaler's village and in my opinion better then Cane and Taro and Hula Grill.  We loved the Ono fish tacos so much, we came back another day for more!  We went to the more casual part on the first floor.  If you go upstairs, it is a different menu and more expensive.  One night we ate up there and the tacos are way better.  I had steak and coconut shrimp.  The shrimp was pretty good but the steak was way overcooked and not very good at all.  I wouldn't eat up there again but bring on those fish tacos any day!  And if you haven't had Hula Pie...you have to try it!  Yum!",Natalie B.,"La Crescenta-Montrose, CA",4.0 star rating
11/5/2012,5.0 star rating,"Leilani's is by far the best of the three restaurants at Whaler's Village. We had no reservation and although it was busy we only had to wait 20 mins for a lovely table. We had opted for the bar and grill menu so we were seated downstairs. Upstairs offered higher end food so you do have the option of both ends of the scale which is nice. Our server Loren was very helpful. My partner ordered the fish tacos (we had been told that the Hula Grill was the place to go for these) and he was very impressed. There were two taco's, the fish was beautifully cooked and he licked the plate, literally! I had fish & chips and again, the fish was so fresh, it was perfectly cooked and while I didn't go so far as licking the plate I did eat everything. We finished off the meal with a Hula Pie which was amazing. The overall cost of the meal was very reasonable (including drinks) and coupled with the great service I'm giving Leilani's 5 stars. One point to note is that we did go to the Hula Grill and the fish tacos were not a patch on Leilani's....",Nicola C.,"Lucan, Dublin, Republic of Ireland",4.0 star rating

Our waiter was great though and he suggested the Ono Fish Tacos...they were AWESOME! Yummy drinks too, had a lava flow, lemon drop and chocolate martini, all tasty. Try the fish tacos for sure...we ate out on the ground...not inside...",Sarah S.,"Fairfield, CA",4.0 star rating
5/4/2008,3.0 star rating,"If you're staying in Kaanapali, feeling lazy and you want average food, good drinks, a nice ocean view then this is probably your spot. If you want really good food made in an interesting way then I would suggest you go somewhere else. This is a nice place but it really doesn't offer much that you can't get elsewhere.",Garry K.,"San Francisco, CA",4.0 star rating

8/19/2012,2.0 star rating,"Stark contrast from our experience two years ago.  Massive crowds, a wait of 1 hour even with a reservation.  Waiter failed to deliver one item that was on the bill, even with a second request for it.  It is true that the restaurant was packed, but still, it should have pulled together.  The order required a steak knife, but the only knife provided went away with the salad plate.  The waiter was so long in re-appearing that I got up and took a knife from a nearby place setting.  Near the end of the meal, he dropped off a steak knife.   When the plates were cleared, the table needed a wipe, but none came, and the waiter put the billing right in the middle of it.  I wrote a note and left a tip of about half of my usual.   The coconut drink""special"" was not right, and on an empty stomach, there was little evidence of even a slight amount of alcohol.   All of the better wines, even average wines, had no by-the-glass availability, but only by the bottle.  We drink little, and thus, 50% or more would have been wasted.   The table was somewhat sticky, probably from people's sun lotions on their arms, and should have been cleaned better.  I watched someone clear the table nearby, and the rag was obvious reused, perhaps for the whole night.   At a minimum, I expect to get what is on the bill and adequate utensils.  The table should have been kept cleaner.   This is not an expensive restaurant, so perhaps I expect too much.   Much better was where we went before, the ""Hula"" restaurant right next to Leilani's.   Also, the ribs BBQ sauce was very ordinary, whereas at the Hula restaurant, it was exceptional and unique.   We will paronize the Hula restaurant again tomorrow.",Tony W.,"Gilroy, CA",4.0 star rating

7/17/2011,2.0 star rating,"i really wanted to like this place but it just didnt cut it. came here on our last night in maui and left with a bad taste in our mouth. started off with mai tais which were tasty but super weak. crab cakes for appetizer which was really good and fresh, boyfriend got the 32oz prime rib and i got the ahi seared mahi mahi. pretty long wait for our food and when it finally came we were already starving. prime rib came out as the 14oz which was wrong so we told our waiter, who was really nice btw. got it changed for him, but while the meat was getting fixed in the kitchen, i decided to attempt to chow. but waiitt, is that a hair i see? omg a loong frikken hair  that i started to pull out of my fish. gross! i told our waiter who immediately apologized numerous times and brought it back. the manager came and apologized to my BOYFRIEND instead of me. wait, but thats MY dish you guys effed up on........was told by the manager ""it will be taken care of. ALSO, let the waiter kno what sweet thing you guys are craving after dinner"" took another 15 minutes for my fish to come out and when it finally did, it did not taste very good at all. after dinner we got the 7 layer chocolate cake for dessert. when the bill came out the only thing that was free was the cake. excuse me? i thought this was going to get taken care of. we asked our waiter and he said he doesnt know why but the manager only wanted to give us the dessert for free and he apologized numerous times again. whatever, no problem but just know that we will never come back again.",Amanda C.,"Cupertino, CA",4.0 star rating

4/9/2009,2.0 star rating,"Really only suitable for lunch, dessert or dinner if you are in a bind.  The ambiance and views are amazing and the best part of the experience. Especially at sunset. The food is nothing special. It isn't bad but in comparison to other things in the price range in the area it falls flat.  The service also sucks!  Our server was obviously trained at a Fridays or Applebee's because he was constantly trying to push more food on us even though we ordered plenty, plus wine and drinks. His tip would have been fine if he wasn't also rude and didn't disappear on us when we needed water and drink refills. We also ordered a side of ginger carrots which had ZERO ginger taste.  Probably because there was no actual ginger on them at all. The hula pie was pretty good. It was enormous but the supposed macadamia nut ice cream that they use to make them is really vanilla with very few, very tiny pieces of macadamia nut in it.",Christopher M.,"North Providence, RI",4.0 star rating
